<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>The 'no-look' fee of the <strong>bankruptcy attorney has increased from $3500 to $4500</strong> as per the revised law. You have to pay $1000 more to the bankruptcy attorney now. So, arrange this money if you're planning to file Chapter 13 bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Please take notice that the “Guidelines for Compensation For Professional Services or Reimbursement of Expenses by Attorneys for Chapter 13 Debtors Under Local Rule 2016-1(B)(2)(a)” have been amended to reflect an increase in the compensation fee that an attorney may charge without application to the court.</p>
<p>The “no-look” fee will increase from $3,500 to $4,500 for all <strong>cases filed under or converted to chapter 13 on or after September 1, 2019</strong>. A Public Notice and the amended “Guidelines” are currently posted on the court website.</p></div>
