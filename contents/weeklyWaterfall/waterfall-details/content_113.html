A single mistake in this form can result to an inflated tax bill, which you would always want to avoid. So, always check this form minutely and find out if there any miscalculation or error. Report to your employer and get a correct W2 form as quickly as possible when there is any error. And, if your employer doesn’t take any action, then file a complaint with the IRS.</p>

<p>It may take a few months to complete the entire process. So, you may have to file an extension. However, the IRS will have all the records explaining that you’re at least working to solve the problem.</p></div>
