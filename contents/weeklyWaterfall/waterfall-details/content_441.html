    <p>California has enacted a new law to add insurance and compensation protections for people who lose their
        properties in wildfires. <strong>Senate Bill 872</strong> has made it easier for future wildfire survivors to
        get critical insurance benefits. It also streamlines the wildfire recovery process for homeowners who suffer
        wildfire losses. A few changes made by the law are:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>The new law requires the residential property insurers to provide an advance payment of at least four months
            of Additional Living Expenses (ALE) to policyholders whose houses are uninhabitable due to wildfire damage
            to critical infrastructure.</li>
        <li>It also eliminates the requirement for an itemized inventory form for content claims.</li>
        <li>Under mandatory evacuation for wildfire, the residents will receive ALE for at least two weeks (even if they
            suffer no damage), with extensions for good cause.</li>
        <li>The bill also instructs that insurance companies can no longer deduct the land value from a claim if a
            wildfire victim relocates rather than rebuilds at the same location.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As California witnesses frequent wildfire devastation, we hope that this new law will help the victims get the
        insurance coverage they deserve from their insurers.</p>
