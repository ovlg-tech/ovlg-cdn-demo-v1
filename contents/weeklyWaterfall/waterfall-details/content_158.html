<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>A vital mistake people make is that they don’t automate their finances. A majority of people, whether they are into business or doing a job, don’t have a bank account to have their paychecks deposited. They receive their paychecks in hand and then deposit it into the bank by physically visiting it. If you’re doing this, you’re wasting on an average 12 hours in a year.</p>

<p>Have your income get directly deposited into your bank account. And once they are safely landed, set automated rules so that a portion of your income goes towards your retirement accounts, a portion into your emergency account, some to pay your regular utility bills, and some towards credit card debts. Doing the same would save you precious time that you could use more effectively.</p></div>
