<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Even before the festive season begins, your email inbox will be filled up with lucrative sale offers. But this doesn’t mean that you should shop immediately. This is because both online and traditional retailers play a smart game called ‘markup to mark down factor'.</p>

<p>Let me explain how this game is played.</p>

<p>Suppose, the price of an item is $10. Now, what online retailers would do is offer "70 percent off on fashion”. They would show the actual price of the item as $100. So, the price of the item after getting a 70 percent discount would be $30. This means the retailer is actually selling the item at a higher price. It’s a win-win deal for the retailer.</p>

<p>Use apps like PriceZombie and SlickDeals Price Tracker to track the price fluctuations. This would help you to comparison shop. You won’t fall for the ‘biggest discount’ bait.</p></div>
