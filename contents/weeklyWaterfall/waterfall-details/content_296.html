<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Dishwasher helps us to save water and energy compare to hand washing dishes. And, if you use the 'air-dry' cycle instead of 'heat-dry' cycle, it can <strong>reduce the energy use 15% to 20%</strong>. You just have to select the air-dry mode after completing the load. If you don't have that option, then turn off the dishwasher once it finished washing. Keep the door open and the dishes will dry automatically without using any electricity. It can also help you to save 15% of the total dishwasher's energy use.</p>
<p>So, if you want to save on your electricity, follow the step. A simple trick can reduce electric consumption and helps you to save $100 a year.</p></div>
