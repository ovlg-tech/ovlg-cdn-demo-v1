<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>The festive season is a time for giving and sharing, an occasion when “the more is the merrier”. Cutting back and saving money doesn't have to mean that our Christmas celebrations become less memorable. Ways that help you enjoy this festive season and be flexible include - keep Christ at the center of Christmas celebrations; make homemade Christmas gifts; give gifts of service; family gift exchange; give practical gifts; make your own Christmas decorations; rethink Christmas cards and gift wrapping; spread out the expense and set a budget and stick to it.</p></div>
