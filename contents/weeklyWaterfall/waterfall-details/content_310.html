<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Have you got any settlement offer from the debt collectors for your time-barred debt before getting any legal notice? If so, then you can <strong>file a lawsuit</strong> against them. As per the FDCPA rule, debt collectors must send you a legal notice to collect the time-barred (a debt, that has crossed the SOL) first. They cannot force you without sending a legal notice. Otherwise, it will be considered as s false, deceptive, or misleading representation, or means of connection. So, if you face such thing, file a lawsuit against them and you can <strong>get up to $1,000 as compensation</strong>.</p>
<p>Don't get worried about the debt collector's calls. Check everything carefully and act accordingly. Because their mistakes can be your benefits.</p></div>
