<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Are you planning to file Chapter 13 bankruptcy when Chapter 7 case is pending? If yes, then the court will dismiss the Chapter 13 case since it <strong>violates the "Single Estate Rule"</strong>.  The court also believes that you cannot maintain simultaneous bankruptcy cases as you own only one estate for the purposes of trusteeship.</p>
<p>As per the bankruptcy rules, if you file simultaneous petitions, it becomes contrary to each other. And, your case will be dismissed. In such a situation, <strong>the court gives you 10 days to consult with a lawyer</strong>. After that, you'll get a chance to select which of the cases would be dismissed. If you can't decide yourself, then the court will dismiss the second case.</p></div>
