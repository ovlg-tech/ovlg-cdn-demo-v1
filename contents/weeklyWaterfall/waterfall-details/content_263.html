<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Do you smoke in cars in presence of your children? If you have that habit, then change it immediately. A new law effected on January 30, 2018, <strong>implemented to protect children from passive smoking</strong>. Violating the law can result in a <strong>fine up to $100</strong>.</p>

<p>The Department of Health reported secondhand smoke is equally harmful to the children as they breathe thousands of chemicals just like the smokers. It increases the risk of cancer, bronchitis, and pneumonia.</p>

<p>The law is <strong>applicable to all the private vehicles</strong> that are enclosed wholly or partly. You can't smoke with the windows or sunroof open, not even with the air-conditioning on. So, think about your child and your pocket and stop smoking in cars.</p></div>
