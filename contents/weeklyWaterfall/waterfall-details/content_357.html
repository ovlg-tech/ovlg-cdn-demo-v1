<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Has a debt collector published your name and debts for public view? If so, then file a lawsuit to win $1000 as this is against the FDCPA law.</p>
<p>As per the FDCPA law, debt collection agencies are not allowed to publish the list of consumers who refused to pay off debts, except to a consumer reporting agency or persons meeting the requirements of section 603(f) or 604(3) of the FDCPA. If a debt collector publishes your name and debts just because you're not paying back your creditors, then it's the violation of federal law. In that case, you can <strong>file a lawsuit against the debt collector for collection abuse and get up to $1000 as a financial reward</strong> from the plaintiff. All you need to do is consult FDCPA attorneys for this matter.</p>
<p>Debt collectors can ask you to settle a debt or make bill payments fast but they can't malign you or threaten you. That's against the law.</p></div>
