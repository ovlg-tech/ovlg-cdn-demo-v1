<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>A new law implemented in California to protect the tenants from the landlords. The law, effective from January 1, 2020, <strong>limits landlordsâ€™ abilities to raise the rent for existing tenants and to terminate their tenancies</strong>.</p>
<p>According to the law, landlords can not evict the tenant who lived there at least 12 months for a no-fault reason. The landlords can not increase the rent more than the cost of living in this area. So, 2020 brings a smile on the faces of tenants in California.</p></div>
