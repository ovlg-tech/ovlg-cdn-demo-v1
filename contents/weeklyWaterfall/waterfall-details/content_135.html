<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Is your college pressurizing you to open a college-sponsored account? If so, then ask questions regarding how your college gets paid. Remember, when your college is asking you to open the account, theyâ€™re only thinking about their financial interests and revenue. They're not at all concerned about your financial future.</p>

<p>In most cases, colleges get a commission for each student that activates a college-sponsored account. Unlike you, this is a fantastic source of income for them. And, they would obviously try to enroll as many students as possible in this account. So beware!</p>

<strong>What you should ask</strong>
<ul>
<li>What about the fees you'll pay</li>
<li>Is the fee more than what you're supposed to pay for other accounts?</li>
<li>What are the basic terms and conditions?</li>   
</ul></div>
