<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>It’s always better to consolidate your debts than filing for Chapter 13 bankruptcy when you’re self-employed. Bankruptcy is the easiest process to get rid of the debts. That’s why we want to opt for this opportunity. But, if you’re self-employed, the <strong>process will be difficult and expensive</strong> than a salaried person. But, if you think logically, you can save more by consolidating debts.</p>
<p>In debt consolidation, you can consolidate all of your debts into a single monthly payment plan. That would be a convenient option for you because this debt relief program won't make you incur additional expenses just because your income is not consistent every month. You just need to make a fixed payment every month. You'll be debt free once you complete the payment plan. <strong>Call 800-530-OVLG to know your option</strong>.</p></div>
