<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Anxious about your upcoming medical bills as you (or your family member) had to get admitted and treated in an out-of-network hospital due to an emergency?</p>
<p>Don't worry! Senate Bill 1264 (A consumer protection law) now prevents Texans from being hit with surprise medical bills when their health care provider and the insurance company can't agree on a payment. Under the new law, insurance companies and medical providers can enter into arbitration to negotiate a payment â€” and state officials would oversee that process, keeping patients out of this fight. <strong>This new law has been enacted on September 01, 2019</strong>. Texas is now among the other few states that have taken strict steps against the surprise medical billing.</p></div>
