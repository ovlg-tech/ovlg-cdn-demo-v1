<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Do you know not only a parent but a grandparent too can open a 529 plan for his/her grandchildren? Though the 529 plan is not tax-deductible under federal law, many states offer their residents a state-income-tax-deduction to contribute to an in-state 529 plan. According to federal tax law, you can contribute up to $15,000 for individuals and $30,000 for a married couple every year.</p>
<p>Along with that, the 529 plan is effective for estate planning. So, as a grandparent, you are welcome to make a 529 plan for your grandchildren as you may get state tax benefits, and it is helpful for your estate planning too!</p></div>
