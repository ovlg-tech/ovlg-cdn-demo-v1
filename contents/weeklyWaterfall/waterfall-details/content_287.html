<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Have you received any <strong>inheritance within 180 days of filing Chapter 7 bankruptcy</strong>? If so, then it becomes the property of the bankruptcy estate. In such a scenario, you have to inform the court and trustee immediately about your additional property and amend forms according to the properties you inherit.</p>
<p>If you receive property like land or house, then amend Schedule A, and if you get money or personal property, then go for Schedule B. On the other hand, if you want to claim the real property or personal property as exempt, then you must amend Schedule C.</p>
<p>Another important factor is that if you delay the collection process by months or years to avoid the inclusion of the property in the bankruptcy estate, then you're making a huge mistake. Only the <strong>date when the decedent passed away matters</strong> and you're entitled to that property from that date.</p></div>
