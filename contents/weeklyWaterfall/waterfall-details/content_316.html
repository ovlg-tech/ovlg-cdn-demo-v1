<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Settling or consolidating your debt is the best option for you if you want to survive the Federal Government Shutdown. As per the report, more than <strong>800,000 federal government employees and contractors are either furloughed or haven't got their paychecks</strong>. The financial crisis is on the way. Pay off the bills or settle the bills as early as possible.</p>
<p>If you have credit card debts, then take care of it. The credit card companies won't wait till you receive your paycheck. The interest rate will accrue on the cards and late fees will be imposed on them. So you have only two options left. Either, you can <a href="https://www.ovlg.com/debt-settlement/credit-card.html">settle your credit card debts</a> or you can consolidate them into an affordable payment plan. If you have payday loans, settle them as soon as possible because the biggest winners from this government shutdown are the payday loan companies. They will levy high-interests if you can't pay off the loans.</p></div>
