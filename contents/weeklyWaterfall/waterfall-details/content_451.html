    <p>Our policymakers' attention has been drawn back to our healthcare system due to this pandemic. As a result, several new laws were entered into effect this year.</p>
<p>Connecticut <strong>House Bill 6003</strong>, which went into effect on January 1, 2021, is one such law.</p>
<p>Under this law, diabetes patients in Connecticut can inform their pharmacist if they have less than a week of medicine and other diabetes-related supplies. After confirming with Connecticut's emergency drug monitoring program, the pharmacist can get these people the supplies they require.</p>
<p>On January 1, 2022, a new provision of this law will take effect. As a result, a 30-day supply of insulin for anyone with state-regulated insurance will cost no more than $25 next year. According to the Connecticut state health department, diabetes is the seventh-highest cause of death, affecting roughly 10%. This law is supposed to assist people in controlling their diabetes at a low cost.</p>
