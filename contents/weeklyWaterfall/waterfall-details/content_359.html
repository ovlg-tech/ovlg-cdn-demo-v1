<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Don't buy commercially bred dogs, cats, and rabbits in California. It's illegal. California is the first state to take action against commercial purchases. These stores are only allowed to <strong>sell animals from animal shelters or animal rescue groups</strong>.</p>
<p>So, while purchasing any animal from the pet store make sure that it is not acquired from commercial breeders. If you find anything suspicious please report to the concerned legal authority. Violation of this law could cause to <strong>$500 fine for each animal they sell</strong>.</p></div>
