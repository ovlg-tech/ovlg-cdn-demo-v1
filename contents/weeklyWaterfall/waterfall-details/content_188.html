<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Are you a student and wasting money by buying textbooks bundled with other unnecessary materials? Know the law and save money.</p>

<p>The <strong>Higher Education Opportunity Act</strong> provides the chance to buy books unbundled, meaning <strong>you can purchase books without the other materials</strong>. You have to pay for the book but not for the supplemental material that you donâ€™t need. This would help you save money and put less pressure on student loans. If you're lucky, you can <strong>save as much as $110 on each textbook</strong>.</p></div>
