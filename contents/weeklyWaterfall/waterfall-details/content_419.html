<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>It's difficult to handle the debt collectors and the collection calls. They always try to reach you by phone, email, or some other possible ways and try to collect the unpaid debts. That's why you should <strong>know the legal rights of a consumer</strong>. If you have an attorney or legal representation and if you have notified the collection agency about this, then you're not supposed to get any collection calls. The collection agency must contact the attorney instead of you.</p>
<p>If they violate this, you can take legal action against them. If you can prove the violation, you will <strong>get the legal fees and a $1,000 fine from the collector or agency</strong>. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has enforced this law to protect consumer rights.</p></div>
