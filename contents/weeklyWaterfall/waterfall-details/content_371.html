<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Good news for the Californian. The new California Finance Law implemented a new law that helps debtors to protect themselves against wage garnishment. As per the law, the <strong>lender or creditor can not take away more than 25% of your weekly earnings</strong> or <strong>50% of the amount by which the debtor's earnings exceed 40 times the minimum hourly wage</strong>.</p>
<p>If the creditor breaks the law, then you have the authority to file a complaint in the court. The court will investigate the case. A "willful" violation may cause <strong>imprisonment for up to one year or a monetary penalty up to $10000</strong>. So, be careful and take action against anything unethical.</p></div>
