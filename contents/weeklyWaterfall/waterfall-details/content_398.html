<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Judgments stay on the credit reports for seven years and it hurts your credit score. But, <strong>civil judgment and tax liens have no relation with your credit score</strong>. If and if you find these on your credit report, ask the respective credit bureaus to remove it. The three main credit bureaus Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion have already started working on removing new records of tax liens and civil judgments since 2017. But still, there're some errors.</p>
<p>According to consumer advocates, these public records are not accurate and not properly updated. So, this can mislead the information. If you have seen anything like these on your credit report, take proper steps, and exclude it from your credit report.</p></div>
