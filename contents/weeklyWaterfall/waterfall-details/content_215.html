<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>If anyone rings you and asks, <strong>“can you hear me?”</strong>, then hang up. Don’t say 'yes'. Your simple answer to the question would push you into financial trouble.</p>

<p>Scammers are playing a dirty game to make money. They would record your voice saying "yes" to use it as a <strong>voice signature for authorizing unwanted charges on your cell phone or other bills</strong>.</p> 

<p>Scammers would use your voice signature to prove that:</p> 
<ul>
<li>You have agreed to upgrade a plan</li>
<li>You have agreed to buy a product</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How to avoid this scam</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Never confirm your phone number or bank account details over phone</li>
<li>Never answer questions in "yes"</li>
<li>Don't receive calls from unknown numbers</li>
