<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Brick and mortal banks are one step ahead of online-only banks. Their physical locations help them to offer various kinds of services to customers. Online banks are well aware of this fact and this is why they try to entice customers with some exclusive offers. For instance, some of these banks don't charge ATM fees since they don't usually have exclusive locations. What these banks actually do is share networks and reimburse you for any fees.</p>
<p>So, if you don't want to spend a penny on the ATM fees, then go for online-only banks.</p></div>
