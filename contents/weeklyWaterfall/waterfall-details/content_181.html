<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Did you get a call from a debt collector recently? Are you wondering if he is a genuine debt collector? If so, then just use this simple tip.</p> 

<p>Ask the debt collector to <strong>reveal the last 4 last digits of your SSN</strong>. A true debt collector would never answer this question since it is against FDCPA laws. But, a fake debt collector would either try to give an answer or might claim that he doesn’t have the information in his file.</p> 

<p>Don’t confirm your personal information over the phone. A fake debt collector may <strong>try to know your SSN</strong> or other details for stealing your identity.</p></div>
