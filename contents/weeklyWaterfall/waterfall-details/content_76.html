<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>A power of attorney is a legal instrument that is used to delegate legal authority to another person. The person who signs a POA is called the principal. The POA gives legal authority to another person, to make property, financial and other legal decisions for the principal. A principal can give an agent legal authority, or very limited authority. So, be alert before appointing a person as your POA.</p></div>
