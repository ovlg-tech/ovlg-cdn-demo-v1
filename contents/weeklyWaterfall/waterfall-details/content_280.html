<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Have you recently filed for bankruptcy? Do you have any plan to pay your attorney by using your cards? If so, then it will be the worst decision of your life. <strong>Paying the bankruptcy attorney with credit cards means your debts are not going to be discharged</strong> in bankruptcy. People file for bankruptcy when they are unable to pay their existing debts. This means you're not supposed to take any further debt. In such a situation, if you use your cards, you'll ruin the entire bankruptcy process by your own hands.</p>
<p>Along with that, if the judge finds that you are not even trying to repay the debts you made just before filing bankruptcy, then also you will lose the case. It comes under fraudulent activity and you can be fined for this. So, be careful and don't use your cards randomly while filing for bankruptcy.</p></div>
