<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Do you have any question regarding a particular product you want to buy from an online retailer? Are you confused since the customer service number is not highlighted in the website? If so, then what would be your next step? Probably, you would type the name in a search engine and try to find out the toll-free number.</p>

<p>But, do you know that it could be a major financial mistake on your part? It would be a mistake to assume that all the toll-free numbers are real customer service lines. Some of these lines are actually maintained by scammers in the hope of getting your credit card number or installing a virus in your computer.</p> 

<p>Here’s a tip you can use to avoid these scammers.</p> 

<p>Go to the official website of the online retailer directly. If the toll-free number is not properly highlighted in the homepage, then either go to the ‘Contact Us’ page or ‘How we can help you’ page. You should get the toll-free number from there.</p></div>
