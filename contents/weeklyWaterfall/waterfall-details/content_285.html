<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Back-to-school shopping season is back and its time for parents and kids to buy all the school supplies. Many parents and adults don't know that kids can <strong>get a big discount if they show their student identification card</strong> at the store. Sometimes, they don't even have to show the card. The kid's presence will do the work for them.</p>
<p>You can <strong>check at bestcollegesonline.com for the retail stores</strong> where you can get the discount. So, always take your kids and their student I.D. cards with you to give some rest to your pockets.</p></div>
