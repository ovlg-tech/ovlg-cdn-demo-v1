<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>In a recent survey by ACCC, it was revealed that issues related to money are the leading cause of stress in relationships. However, another thing was revealed too that couples are discussing their financial issues more often, which is a good sign.</p>

<p>Indeed, money is the root cause of every evil. So if things are communicated well and remain clear to both spouses, there won’t be any bitterness arising due to finances.</p>

<p>It might not sound very romantic or reasonable, but it’s best to be clear from the very first day. In any relationship, each person’s financial values and goals are important and sometimes those differ. While one gives value to each penny and saves for future, the other person splurges all the time. If you just have a conversation about your financial preferences, this might lead to better understanding, and you both might compromise for a happy conjugal life.</p>

<p>I’m not saying that it’s the only vital thing you should talk about. Rather it’s one of the vital topics you should discuss to avoid tension down the road.</p></div>
