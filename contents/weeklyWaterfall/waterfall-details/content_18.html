<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Saving money and paying off debt both are vital goals. It is good to save. But its quite illogical to save when you are deeply immersed in debt. Simple maths suggest it’s better to get rid of debt before saving for retirement or an emergency fund. If the savings rate is 1% and you have credit card debt at 14% interest, money is better spent paying down debt quickly. If you pay your debt first and put no money in savings, then you have nothing but your credit cards to fall back on if there’s a financial emergency. Using your credit cards to fund an emergency only makes it harder to pay off debt. So, don’t save it all. Prioritize between your debts and savings and act accordingly.</p></div>
