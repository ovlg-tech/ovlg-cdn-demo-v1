<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Are you confused about filing bankruptcy second time? Relax! <strong>You can file bankruptcy multiple times</strong>. You just need to check out the laws. Under Chapter 7 bankruptcy, you have to wait 8 years from the day a Chapter 7 bankruptcy was filed to file another one and receive a discharge and for Chapter 13, wait at least two years from the day your last Chapter 13 was filed before you can file and receive a discharge for another one.</p>
<p>If youâ€™re filing under a different chapter the second time around, the rules are different. If your first filing was under Chapter 13, you've to <strong>wait at least 6 years from the date you filed your Chapter 13</strong> and if your first case was a Chapter 7, <strong>you only have to wait four years before filing a Chapter 13</strong>. There are no limitations of filing bankruptcy several times but if you don't know the laws, the process may delay.</p></div>
