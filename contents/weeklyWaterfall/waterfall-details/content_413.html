<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>The new FDCPA rule states that making more than seven calls in one week in regards to a specific debt is considered harassment. And once the collector has spoken with the consumer, the collection agency must wait a week before calling the consumer again in regards to the debt.</p>
<p>If a debt collector calls you more than 7 times in a week, then you can call 800-530-OVLG to find against the abusive debt collection practices. The attorneys can not only help you to fight against abusive debt collection practices but also help to settle your debt.</p></div>
