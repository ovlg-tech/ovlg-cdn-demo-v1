<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>If you are a first time home buyer, as per the 10-10 rule you need to make a down payment of at least 10%, and going to commit to living in your house for at least 10 years.</p>

<p>Making a down-payment of at least 10% is good as in case the market drops, you’ll still have some equity.</p>

<p>And since you’ll live in the house for at least 10 years, you’ll actually ride through the negative cycle of 10 years, and chances are there that your house will again start to appreciate by the end of the period.</p>

<p>Just living for 3-5 years in a house won’t take you anywhere as long as financial gains are concerned.</p></div>
