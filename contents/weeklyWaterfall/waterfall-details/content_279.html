<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Do you have any plan to file bankruptcy in the near future? Are you trying to save your home by transferring it to your relatives before filing bankruptcy? If you have such plans, then be careful. <strong>Transferring or hiding property in bankruptcy</strong> file is not at all a good idea. You have to disclose all of your assets, otherwise you won't be eligible to discharge your debts.</p>
<p>Hiding or transferring property beforehand will be considered as a fraudulent activity and you could be <strong>charged up to $500,000 or imprisonment up to five years or both</strong>. Along with that, you won't be able to discharge your debts. So, never think of hiding anything, the more transparent you stay, the more advantages you'll gain.</p></div>
