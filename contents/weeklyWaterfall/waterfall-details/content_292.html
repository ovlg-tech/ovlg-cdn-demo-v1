<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Are you worried about your pet's custody in the divorce? It's a real concern for all the Americans who are going to file divorce. But, if you're in Illinois, there's a good news for you. As per the new <strong>"Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage Act" (PA 100-0422), pets should be considered as an inseparable member</strong> of the family like children and they should not be treated as dividing assets. So, the court will decide whether the pet will get sole custody or joint custody.</p>
<p>
This law will help many of us to solve our pet's custody in case of divorce. But, <strong>this law is not effective for the service animals</strong> because it's a property of an organization and it would be placed with the authorized person.</p></div>
