<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Impatience is not a virtue. Rather, it's a curse. In fact it can cost you a lot of money. A Columbia based business school associate professor found in his research that impatient people are more likely to have low credit score. As you already know, low credit score can make it very difficult to obtain loan at low interest rate. So, when you apply for loans, you're likely to face strict terms and conditions.</p>
<p>One sudden decision (technically keeping short-term goals in mind) may help you now, but it'll cost you in the long run. So, before making a financial move, have patience, think carefully and then decide.</p></div>
