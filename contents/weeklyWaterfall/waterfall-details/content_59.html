<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Federal and state laws require most employers to pay overtime.  The overtime premium is 50% of the employee's usual hourly wage. This means an employee who works overtime must be paid the employee's usual hourly wage plus the 50% overtime premium, for every overtime hour worked. These laws contain many exceptions, so not all employees are entitled to overtime. Employees who are eligible for overtime are called "nonexempt" employees, and those who are not eligible for overtime are called "exempt" employees. In California, if you work for more than 12 hours a day you should receive extra payments for that. So, ask your employer for that extra payment for your extra time.</p></div>
