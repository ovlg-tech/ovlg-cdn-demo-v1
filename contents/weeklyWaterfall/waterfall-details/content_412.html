<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Once you file for bankruptcy, you have to maintain the court proceedings. <strong>Don't try to influence or bribe the creditor in bankruptcy</strong>. Offering any cash to the creditor is considered bankruptcy fraud as per the 18 U.S.C.A. Section 152. It is an illegal approach and you can be penalized for doing this offence.</p>  
<p>The creditor can not file a claim against the debtor once he/she files for bankruptcy. If you can't afford to pay off your debts, you can file for bankruptcy. There's nothing wrong with filing bankruptcy. Any illegal activities can cancel your bankruptcy proceedings.</p></div>
