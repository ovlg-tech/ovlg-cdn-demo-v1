<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Are you planning for filing bankruptcy soon? If yes, then you have to <strong>collect the state-issued REAL ID driverâ€™s license or identification card</strong>. Anyone entering the federal buildings or federal courthouses must carry the REAL Id, otherwise, he/she won't be allowed to enter. The rule extends to bankruptcy filers who must attend mandatory appearances at the federal courthouse, such as the 341 meetings of creditors required by all individual filers, or a Chapter 13 confirmation hearing.</p>
<p>Initially, the date of compliance with the REAL ID Act was set for October 1, 2020. But, due to the outbreak of Covid19, President Trump has announced to increase the deadline. However, it's always better to get your REAL ID as early as possible.</p></div>
