<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Do you know one of the easiest tricks to save money on your refrigerator? Just <strong>clean the fridge top</strong> and keep it empty every time. If you place something on the fridge top, it reduces the ventilation system of your fridge. And, <strong>poor ventilation makes the fridge less energy efficient</strong>. Hence, it reflects on the cost of your electricity bill.</p>
<p>So, avoid placing items on the top of your fridge and keep it clean and tidy as much as possible. It not only helps you to reduce the electricity bill but also increases the longevity of your refrigerator.</p></div>
