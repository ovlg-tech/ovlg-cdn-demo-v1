<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Are you worried about your high-interest credit card debt? Of course, it's a matter of concern. But, if you wish, you can get rid of this situation. You can <strong>negotiate with them for reducing your credit card interest</strong>. If you meet their requirements, they will reduce the interest rates.</p>
<p>If you have a good credit score and if you have been diligent about making all your payments on time, then you can lower your credit card interest rate. To do this you need to call up your credit card customer service number and remind the representative of your <strong>good credit history and your history of being a good customer</strong> (by regularly using your card and paying your bills on time). So, don't hesitate to ask for the favor to the benefits.</p></div>
