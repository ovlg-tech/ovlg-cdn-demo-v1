<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Are you a new mom suffering from maternal mental health issues? Are you not able to afford the treatment as your insurance doesn't cover it?</p>
<p>Maternal mental health issues or postpartum issues are very common among new mothers and can also negatively impact their overall health if not taken care of. But many new mothers ignore this issue when their insurances don't cover it as the out of pocket medical expense is pretty high in our country. But not anymore!</p>
<p>Starting from this year, AB-577 Health care coverage Act ensures that mothers diagnosed with a maternal mental health disorder, whose providers leave their insurance network can still see that provider and be <strong>fully covered for up to 12 months</strong>. A separate change in the budget extends Medi-Cal coverage to moms with mental health disorders to one year, up from the current 60 days.</p></div>
