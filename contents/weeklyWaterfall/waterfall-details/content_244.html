<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Don’t park your car within 15 feet of a fire hydrant since it is illegal. You have to <strong>pay a fine of $115 for breaking this law</strong>. You can keep your car alongside a fire hydrant between sunrise and sunset. But the catch is the licensed operator has to remain behind the wheel and move the car if required to do so. Remember, <strong>you’re not allowed to keep your car within 15 feet</strong> of a fire hydrant at night. In California, you have to pay a fine of $80.</p></div>
