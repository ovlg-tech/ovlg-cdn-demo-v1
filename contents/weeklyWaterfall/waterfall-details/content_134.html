<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>A currency can be damaged or mutilated in several ways: chemicals, water, fire, animals, insects, etc. Just think what your mental state would be when your $100 note gets mutilated or damaged? No one would agree to take it and you can’t even keep it in your piggy bank for future use.</p>

<p>So, what can you do in this situation? What’s the remedy?</p>

<p>Well, the bureau of Engraving and Printing has a panel of trained experts who can help you. They would examine your currency minutely. If they find that almost 50 percent of the note is recognizable as US currency and the rest of the part is completely damaged, then they would redeem the full value without charging any penny.</p></div>
