<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Everyone has the right to medical care. Unfortunately, some miscreants think they have a right to use your medical insurance to receive care and services without paying a dime. To protect your medical identity follow these guidelines - be vigilant about your personal information; donâ€™t share your health information with solicitors and phishers; avoid sharing sensitive information; read the EOB, preferably via email; move quickly with breach notifications and check credit reports and medical records regularly. </p></div>
