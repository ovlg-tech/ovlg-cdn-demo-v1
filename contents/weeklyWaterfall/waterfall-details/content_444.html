    <p>The <strong>Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act (CADA)</strong> went into force in January to help the Colorado
        Civil Rights Commission (CCRD) protect low-income renters from discrimination. Under <strong>CADA</strong>,
        Colorado landlords (with some exceptions) can no longer refuse prospective tenants based on their source of
        income, including public housing vouchers.</p>
    <p>The latest modifications came from <strong>HB 20-1332</strong>, which Governor Jared Polis signed into law in
        July 2020. The new law is expected to help many low-income people find and keep housing, especially those who
        rely on vouchers or non-traditional income streams. Under CADA, ads for apartments or houses can no longer
        feature restrictions or preferences based on income sources. Landlords can still do the credit checks on
        potential tenants to access eligibility, but only if they do so for all tenants, not just those with vouchers or
        unusual sources of income. Landlords with three or fewer rental units and single-family landlords with five or
        fewer residences are exempt.</p>

    <p>Anyone facing discrimination due to their verifiable and legal source of income can make a formal complaint on
        the CCRD's website.</p>
