<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>It is worst when you find yourself declared as dead by the credit bureaus. However, such credit report errors are common. Being reported as dead can happen to those who share an account with someone who has died, namely a spouse or a family member - if you share the same last name, human error can take its toll. </p>
<p>Here are some steps which you can follow in case you need to prove your identity</p>
<ol><li>find the source of the mistake&gt;/li&gt;
</li><li>Inform Equifax, Experian(EXPN) and TransUnion of the error</li>
<li>keep a record of all correspondence regarding your claim</li>
<li>follow up with the entity that falsely claimed you were dead and request lost benefits or take legal action.</li></ol></div>
