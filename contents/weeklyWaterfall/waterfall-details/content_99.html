<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>So you want to host a rocking party for your friends and family but don't have a big budget for it. A full course meal will cost you thousands of dollars. But lip-smacking appetizers will create less pressure on your wallet and at the same time allow guests to gossip more. Some cost-effective but mouth-watering appetizers are mini pizzas, mini grilled sandwiches, stews, etc. Try to avoid offering jumbo prawns or prime ribs as they're very expensive. Another tip will be to serve in small plates so that your guests feel less inclined to load up their plates with humungous amount of food. </p></div>
