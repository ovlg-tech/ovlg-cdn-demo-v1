<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Do you keep your freezer full everytime? If yes, then you're smarter than those who don't use the space properly. <strong>A full freezer runs better and consumes less energy</strong>. You can save a lot on your electricity bill.</p>
<p>Once we open the freezer, cold air escapes and warm air comes in. And when we close the door, the freezer has to start cooling things again. If we keep the freezer full, the chance of losing the cool air is less since the empty space is less. On the other hand, if you lose power, a full freezer helps to keep the food safe twice as long as compared to an empty freezer.</p>
<p>So, always try to <strong>keep your freezer full</strong>. Use water bottles or plastic bags full of water in the empty space to get the same effect.</p></div>
