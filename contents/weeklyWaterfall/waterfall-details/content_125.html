<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Beware of the risk-free trial offers for skincare products you often see in different websites. You'll get these offers in the form of pop-ups and banners in different webpages. These companies will ask you to give your credit card number in exchange of 100% satisfaction guaranteed offer and a minimum shipping charge.</p>

<p>In most cases, they charge low shipping cost in order to attract consumers. And if they still try to leave the webpage, then these companies would dip shipping charges even more. If all these strategies fail, then they would play their trump card and that is A- rating from the BBB.</p>

<p>Till now, everything seems to be fair and good. But the shock comes later when consumers are slapped with a hefty fee ($97) for not returning the skincare products in the next 10 days. The fee  is usually written in the Fine Print section, so most consumers skip this part. This is not the end. These companies enroll consumers in subscription plans without even notifying them. As a result, consumers have to pay extra charges till the cancellation of these plans.</p></div>
