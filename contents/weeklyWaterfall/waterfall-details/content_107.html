<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Yes, no matter how much we criticize the IRS for not receiving phone calls when you desperately needs it’s help, yet we can’t help but applaud the service for proving last-minute relief to taxpayers.</p> 

<p>The IRS discovered 14 days ago that a big fraction of the taxpayers who purchased insurance policies on a state or federal exchange and were ideal candidates for the premium tax credit would have to pay for the extra advance credit they got. To give some relief to taxpayers, the IRS has issued Notice 2015-9 which states that if a taxpayer’s liability is comprised of premium tax credit, then they would not charge a late filing penalty.</p></div>
