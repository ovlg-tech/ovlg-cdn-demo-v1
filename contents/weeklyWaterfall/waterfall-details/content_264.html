<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Are you having excessive medical expenses? Don't worry, file it on your tax return. The <strong>IRS allows you to deduct medical costs on your taxes</strong> if they are more than 10% of your adjusted gross income.</p>

<p>The money you spend on preventative care, treatment, surgeries, dental and vision care can be deducted. It's also applicable for psychological or psychiatrist visits. Prescribed medications along with appliances like glasses, contacts, false teeth and hearing aid are there in the list.</p>

<p>You just need to <strong>file an itemized deduction instead of standard deduction</strong> to get the benefits. And, you have to prove that your itemized deduction is greater than the standard deduction.</p></div>
