<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Next time you travel, make sure you <strong>search for air ticket prices as a single person</strong>. Airlines show the highest price when you search for multiple tickets. For instance, if you buy 5 air tickets, then the airline will consider the highest price for each ticket and calculate the total amount. So it is a wise idea to search for tickets as one person. In the checkout process, you can choose your seats so that your family members can sit together.</p></div>
