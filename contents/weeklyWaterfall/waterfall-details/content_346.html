<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Repay your debts to save your social security benefits from getting levied. In case of federal income taxes, the Treasury Department can either levy <strong>15% of your benefit until the debt is paid off or garnish everything</strong> but living expenses until the debt is paid off. This can happen due to federal student loans too. Also, repay your unpaid alimony or child obligations. The debt collectors can get a court order to tap your bank accounts to recover the amount.</p>
<p>If you pay your debts without any default, then you don't need to be worried. It happens when you default your debts and it becomes too high to pay off. So, it's always better to pay off your debts as early as possible to enjoy your social security benefits without any obligations.</p></div>
