<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>When you’re at home, <b>set the air conditioner's thermostat setting at 78 degrees Fahrenheit</b> and be comfortable during the summer months. But, increase the temperature of your air conditioner’s thermostat setting to more than 78 degrees Fahrenheit when you’re not at home and don’t need cooling. This will help you save <b>5 percent to 15 percent</b> on your air-conditioning bills.</p>

<p>If you want to save more, just <ins>leave the air conditioner off</ins> when you’re going for a vacation for a few days. Granted, you’ll feel uncomfortable once you get back home, but the unpleasantness is temporary. You’ll feel good as you turn on the air conditioner.</p></div>
