<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Sometimes, debt collectors use tricks to collect the debt that is already paid off. They know people get scared by the collection calls and agree to their terms without questioning anything. Don't be scared. If the debt is not yours or if you find that the debt has crossed the SOL, you can dispute the debt. According to the FDCPA Law, <strong>the collection agency must validate the debt by providing you the name of the creditor and the amount you owe</strong>. If you believe the information is incorrect, you can dispute the debts within 30 days. It's the job of the collection agency to prove that the debt belongs to you by providing accurate information.</p>
<p>Once you dispute the debt, the debt collectors can't call you or contact you by any means. So, don't get worried, handle the collection calls tactfully.</p></div>
