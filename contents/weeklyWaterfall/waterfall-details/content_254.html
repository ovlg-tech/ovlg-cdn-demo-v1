<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Are you a self-employed person? Be careful and <strong>never mix your personal and business assets</strong>. Most self-employed people have a tendency to put their business earnings into their personal savings account. This is not right and it has few negative impacts for future perspectives, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>If you file for bankruptcy, you can lose both of your business and personal assets.</strong></li>
<li><strong>You can't claim certain tax deductions for not using proper accounts.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>So, it's better to avoid mixing the accounts and create a payment schedule to pay yourself accordingly. This will not only <strong>help you with legal and tax issues</strong> but it'll also help you to find out the growth of your business.</p></div>
