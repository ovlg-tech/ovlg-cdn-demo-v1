<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Has your doctor asked you to <strong>drop pounds since your current body weight is putting your health at risk</strong>? If so, then request him or her to mention this in the prescription. Once your doctor gives you the updated prescription, you can use it to get tax deductions.</p>

<p>You can deduct the total expense you bear from your income tax to shed pounds. If you enroll in a weight loss program or any other program to treat obesity or tension or cholesterol, then you can qualify for tax deduction.</p> 

<p>Just remember, the <strong>total cost should be more than 7.5% of your adjusted gross income</strong>.</p></div>
