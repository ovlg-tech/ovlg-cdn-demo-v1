<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Free promotional reward cards are nothing but ‘marketing gimmicks’. These cards can expire quickly. Moreover, you’ve to take a series of steps to activate these reward cards. For instance, Sprint is offering the American Express Prepaid Reward Card to lure consumers. Most consumers will be too happy to receive this card, but they’re not aware of the fact that:</p>

<ul>
<li>This is not a gift card.</li> 
<li>This card is not regulated by federal laws</li> 
<li>It will take 10 weeks to activate this card</li> 
<li>Consumers need to pay $3 each month after 7 months</li> 
</ul>

<p>Again, ATT is offering ATT Reward Card from US bank to attract new customers. The activation period for this card is 7 weeks. The card will expire after 3 months and has a $7 card replacement fee.</p> 

<p>These free promotional cards don’t have any legal protection. Plus, you can’t enjoy most of these cards for a long period. So, before making any purchase, just think - “Do I really need to buy a product to get this card? Will I benefit from this card in the long term?”.</p></div>
