<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Seen that ad - “70 percent off cheap resorts”? Decided to go for this vacation package within a few minutes? Wait!

<br>It’s easy to feel excited since the offer is really very good. But do you know that this can be a perfect scheme to scam you. Yes, most of these free or so called “low-cost” travel packages cost you a huge amount of money in hidden costs. After you’ve made the initial deposit, you’ll find that you’d have to pay extra money at the spot or resort to grab the ‘great deal’. That’s not all. To your utter shock, you may also find that that the quality of the package is not at all good.</p>
