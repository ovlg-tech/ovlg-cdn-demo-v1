To get rid of bad money habits during financial fast days you need to follow these rules - make it last for 21 days; only purchase those things which you need; pay with cash only and keep a spending journal. There are some pros and cons attached to it also. The benefits that you will get are - become more conscious of your spending habits; get on top of your current finances; reduce what you put on credit cards and reduce temptation.

For a successful financial fast you need to know these tips - delineate between needs and wants; you need to get accountable and remove your temptations away and you can also do remixing without spending a penny. Finally once you finish your 21 day stint, you can celebrate your success. If you can understand the rules and guidelines of a financial fast and work accordingly, you can set a path toward a better financial responsibility.</p></div>
