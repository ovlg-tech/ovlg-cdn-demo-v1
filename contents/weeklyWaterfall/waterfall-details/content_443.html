    <p>Do you belong to a low-income household and need to weatherize your home?</p>

    <p>California's <strong>Low-Income Weatherization Program (LIWP)</strong>, administered by the California Dept. of Community Services and Development, will assist such households in weatherizing their home. This program (SB 535) provides eligible low-income households with rooftop solar systems, solar hot water heating systems, and energy efficiency upgrades at zero cost.</p>
    
    <strong>Eligibility criteria</strong>:
    <ul>
    <li>Property must be located in a CalEPA Disadvantaged Community.</li>
    <li>At least one building on site must contain 5 units or more.</li>
    <li>At least 66% of residents with incomes equal to or less than 80% of the area median income (AMI).</li>
    <li>Must be able to achieve at least 15% energy saving.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    <strong>LIWP</strong> is designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and household energy costs by saving energy and generating clean, renewable power for single households and multi-family affordable housings. Parallelly, it also helps reducing household energy costs for low-income families and contributes to community health by improving air quality. </p>
