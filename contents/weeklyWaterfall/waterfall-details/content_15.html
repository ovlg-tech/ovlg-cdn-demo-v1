<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Embracing a new loan to pay off previous ones is unreasonable. If you take up a new loan to pay off the old one, then let me remind you that you are again making the same mistake! If you go on doing this, then one fine day you will realise that you have landed up in a debt-trap, which is alarming. So, donâ€™t borrow and avoid falling into debt . Organize and prioritize your expenses to live a debt-free life.</p></div>
