<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>While COVID 19 rage is slowing down, many are still concerned about their workplace sanity or want to confirm whether employers are taking necessary steps if someone tests positive.</p>
<p>The good news is, as per <strong>New COVID-19 Exposure and Notification Law (AB 685)</strong>, all private and public employers who will receive notice of potential exposure to COVID-19 must provide written notice to all employees who may have been exposed. They should also provide COVID-19 benefits-related information like worker's compensation, COVID-19-related leave, and paid sick leave, as well as the employer's anti-discrimination and anti-retaliation policies within one day. </p>
<p>If an "imminent hazard" is found, Cal/OSHA can even shut down the workplace to minimize the hazard and ensure employees' safety.</p></div>
