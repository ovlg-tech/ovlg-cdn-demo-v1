<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Have you got any letter from the debt collector regarding your unpaid debt? Go through the letter carefully and check whether the debt collector mentioned the exact debt amount and interest rates separately or not. Make sure the <strong>debt collector reveals the itemized interest and fees applied to a debt owed</strong>. If they donâ€™t do it, they are supposed to use $0.00 for charges.</p>
<p>According to FDCPA, the debt collectors must mention every detail of debts including the interest and other charges. As a debtor, you have the right to know everything about the debts you owe. So, read the document carefully and take action accordingly.</p></div>
