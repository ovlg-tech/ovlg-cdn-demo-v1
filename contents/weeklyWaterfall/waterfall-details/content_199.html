<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Got a shipping alert into your inbox that looks like it’s from FedEx, and want to track the product which you have just ordered online few days ago? Be aware! It might be an online scam. Fraudsters send fake shipping alerts in the hope that you’ll click on the link, which <strong>injects malware on to your machine or redirects you to a phishing website</strong>.</p>

<p>Always <strong>track your product by using the tracking number</strong> you got in the initial mail after purchasing it and go to the store’s website to track any package.</p></div>
