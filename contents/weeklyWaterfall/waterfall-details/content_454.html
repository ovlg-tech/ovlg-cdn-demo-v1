    <p>A number of new labor rules are being enacted in California, and they will take effect next year. Governor Newsom
        recently signed <strong>AB 1033</strong>, which expands the <strong>California Family Rights Act</strong>
        (<strong>CFRA</strong>) leaves. Under this law, employers must provide eligible employees with 12 weeks of
        job-protected time off every year to care for their in-laws who are in critical medical condition.</p>
    <p>Currently, CFRA allows <strong>12 weeks</strong> of job-protected leave each year for employees to bond with a
        new child or care for urgent medical needs. On the other hand, parents-in-law will be included in this list as a
        result of AB 1033. This extension presently excludes private firms with fewer than 5 employees. AB 1033 also
        provides a mediation pilot program for firms with 5 to 19 employees.
    </p>
    <p>In general, an employee must have worked for the employer for a minimum of one year and 1,250 hours in the 12
        months before requesting this increased job-protected time off under the CFRA.</p>
