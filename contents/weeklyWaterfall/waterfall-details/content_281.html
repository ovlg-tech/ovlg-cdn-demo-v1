<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Did you buy anything recently? Did you check the minimum warranty period? Earlier, we used to get a minimum 60 days warranty but the <strong>new law implemented in January 2018, helps people to get a warranty of minimum 90 days</strong> on any product or services.</p>
<p>According to the Federal Law, the consumer can demand a <strong>written warranty for the product over $15</strong>. So, if any company or retailers refuse to give you the product warranty, you can complain to the FDCPA to get legal help. Remember, this law is applicable to warranty based products only. So, don't overlook the warranty periods anymore and if you find anything wrong, make a complaint immediately.</p></div>
