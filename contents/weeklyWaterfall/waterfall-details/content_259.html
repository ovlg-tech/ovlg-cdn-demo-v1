<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Water heaters manufactured in the last decade don’t need additional insulation. But the same thing can’t be said about old water heaters. Touch your old water heater. If it’s warm, then it needs additional insulation. Put a water heater blanket around it. This will keep the heat within the heater and make the water heater consume less energy. You can <strong>save $20 to $45 a year by doing this</strong>.</p>

<p>The wrap makes it very difficult to know if the water heater has any leakage or any corrosion. This is why old water heaters fail. So check your water heater minutely before wrapping an old blanket around it.
