<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Being a parent is a costly affair nowadays. There are so many expenses related to raising a child. But, there is a time in the year when parents get financial benefits for being a parent. And, this is the tax season.</p> 

<p>There are several tax deductions available for parents. The IRS knows that parents spend a lot for raising kids and offers lots of tax deductions under the following circumstances:</p>  
<ol>
<li>You have a child who is below 19 years old.</li> 
<li>You have a child who is below 24 years old (he/she should be a full-time student or disabled).</li> 
<li>You have grandchildren who fulfills the eligibility criteria.</li> 
</ol>
<p>Remember, if you’re divorced, then only one parent can take tax exemption.</p>  

<p>You can get maximum $4050 personal tax exemption when you’re filing income tax returns.</p></div>
