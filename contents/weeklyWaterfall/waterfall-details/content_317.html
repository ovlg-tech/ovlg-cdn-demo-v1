<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Are you frustrated with the debt collection calls for your debt? Don't you want to pay back the debt collector? If so, then you can <strong>send a Cease and Desist (C&amp;D) letter to the collection agency and get relief</strong> from the debt collectors. According to the FDCPA law, debt collectors can't contact you when you send a Cease and Desist letter to them. If they contact or harass you even after sending the letter, then you can sue them for abusive debt collection practices.</p>
<p>But what if you're getting collection calls from a creditor? Well, in that case, you should try to settle the debt. The FDCPA law is only applicable to the third-party debt collection agencies, not to the creditors.</p>
<p>Even when you're sending a Cease and Desist letter to a debt collection agency, try to contact the original creditor and let him know that you wish to work with him directly. You can negotiate a repayment plan with him or consult <a href="https://www.ovlg.com/">OVLG</a> for knowing about the budgeting and bill payment options.</p></div>
