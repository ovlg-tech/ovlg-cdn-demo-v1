    <p>Are you a New Yorker tenant living in a multiple-dwelling apartment that has smart access? Are you afraid that your data may get compromised by landlords? On 30th May, New York City enacted <strong>Tenant Data Privacy Act (TDPA)</strong> to ensure the safety of tenants from a data breach.</p>
    <p>Under TDPA, the landlords of smart access buildings must obtain consent from tenants to use smart access systems. They also need to implement security measures to protect collected data. The law prohibited landlords from location tracking outside the premises or measuring tenants/guests' entry-exit frequency. The information of internet service and utility usage by tenants are strictly excluded from data collection.</p>
    <p>If you are a tenant whose data is sold and used in violation of the TDPA, you will have a private right of action under the TDPA law. The law enables such tenants to seek compensatory or statutory damages ranging from <strong>$200</strong> to <strong>$1,000</strong> per tenant and the attorneys' fees.</p>
