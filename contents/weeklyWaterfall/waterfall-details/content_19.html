<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>If you know that you will receive money from any investment or insurance tomorrow, then don’t prepare your life according to it. Out of your imagination, you might realize that life has just played a prank with you and you are left with not a single penny in your hand. So, don’t spend tomorrow’s income today. Plan your life with what you have in hand not with what you will get, as its better to predict things after they have happened.</p></div>
