<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Insulin affordability has got a bit easier this year for the Washington residents with diabetes. To support low-income Americans by increasing their affordability for insulin, <strong>HOUSE BILL 2662</strong> has imposed a $100 cap on patient copayments throughout 2021.</p>
<p>The law is applicable for any health care plan issued or renewed this year that covers insulin drugs. This law is practically a blessing for the people living with diabetes as this disease is a potential risk factor for COVID-19, and insulin is like life support for them.</p></div>
