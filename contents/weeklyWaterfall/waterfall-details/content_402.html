<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Good news for the debtors. The debt collectors must carry the license to collect unpaid debts in California. Starting from January 1, 2021, the Debt Collection Licensing Act (SB 908) enforces the <strong>debt collectors and debt buyers to have a license</strong>. They can apply for the license from the California Department of Business Oversight (DBO).</p>
<p>This Act will protect consumers from unlawful practices of debt collection and mental harassment. This will also help the debtors to get back their consumer rights and they can feel protected by the laws. So, if any debt collector contacts you without a license, you can ignore that calls or threats.</p></div>
