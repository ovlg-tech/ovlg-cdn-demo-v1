<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Have you ever been a victim of discrimination upon your national origin by your lenders? If so, then you can <strong>complain and get compensation up to $16,000</strong>. As per the Fair Housing Act, you can sue a lender if you think the Laws of Fair Housing Act are not followed, that is if theyâ€™ve imposed stringent underwriting standards when you shop for a loan to buy a home. Other than that, the lender is not allowed to discriminate you based on your religion, sex, race, color, disability, family status, etc.</p>
<p>If you find any violation of this law, make a complaint and you can get compensation up to $16,000.</p></div>
