The federal penalty for not buying a health insurance policy is <strong>$695 or 2.5% of your taxable income</strong>. The penalty is a big concern for the people who have been eligible for coverage but are uninsured. Previously, people had to pay <strong>$325 or 2 percent of income as a penalty</strong> for being uninsured. But in 2016, the figure has almost become double.</p></div>
