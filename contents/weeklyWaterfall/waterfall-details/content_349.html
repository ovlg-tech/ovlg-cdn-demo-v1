<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>It's not easy to negotiate with the IRS to settle your tax debt for pennies on the dollar. But, it's possible! You have to convince the IRS that you don't have the assets or income to pay off the debts in a reasonable time. If you're broke and can't manage the money to pay of your taxes, IRS will surely give you the concession. This process is called <strong>"Offer in Compromise" or "OIC"</strong>. It's an agreement between the taxpayer and IRS for settling the taxpayer's tax amount for less than the full amount owed. To qualify for this process, you have to convince the IRS that:</p>
<li>You won't be able to pay off the full tax amount in a reasonable time.</li>
<li>You found that the tax amount unusual.</li>
<li>Due to some unavoidable circumstances, the payment could cause financial hardship to you.</li></div>
