<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Never forget to claim the temporary license plates from your car dealers while buying a new car or lease a car. According to the law in California, starting January 1, 2019, <strong>any new or leased car driven off a dealer's lot must have a temporary license</strong>. Otherwise, you have to pay a hefty fine. 35 other states already have this law and California is the new inclusion.</p>
<p>Previously, new or leased car holders can use a paper advertisement. The dealers submit the registration application to the DMV and they issue 2 license plates (one for the front and other for the back side). The car holders get 90 days for putting those plates on the car.</p></div>
