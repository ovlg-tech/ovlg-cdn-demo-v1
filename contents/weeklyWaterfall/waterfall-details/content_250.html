<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Do not call your insurance company's hot-line/toll-free number unless there's some emergency. Many insurance companies have a tendency to <strong>count an inquiry over a phone as a claim</strong>. As a result, they try to do everything to refuse the renew of the policy or even drop the policy, as thereâ€™s a possibility to make a claim in the future.</p>
<p>So, try to avoid calling to the company. Rather call your insurance agent. If you don't have an agent, then check your policy documents carefully for your queries. If you still have to call them, then make sure you mention that the <strong>call is for general inquiry and not to make any claim</strong>. Usually, the calls are recorded and it can help you to stay safe from false claims.</p></div>
