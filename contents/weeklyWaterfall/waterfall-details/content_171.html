<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Beware of the laws before you take your car on the <b>High-Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lane</b>, more popularly known as the ‘carpool’ lane since you have to pay $100-$481 for violating the rules. Some of the rules you need to follow are:</p> 
<ol>
<li>You can drive a vehicle having 2 or more occupants in the peak hours (6 a.m - 10 a.m) and (3pm and - 7pm) on the HOV lane on Monday through Friday.</li>
<li>Other vehicles can use the lanes in off-peak hours</li>
<li>In case of a ‘qualified clean alternative fuel vehicle’, one is free to travel in the lane without extra passengers</li>
<li>One can’t cross over double yellow lines to get in or get out of a carpool lane.</li> 
</ol></div>
