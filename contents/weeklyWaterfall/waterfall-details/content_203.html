<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Pay your <strong>January’s mortgage payment by December 31</strong> and when you file your tax return next year, you can deduct the mortgage interest on your Schedule A.</p>
<p>Also, if you’ve decided to take advantage of the <strong>extra interest deduction</strong>, make it fast. Doing so, your mortgage company will get sufficient time to make it reflect on your annual Form 1098 which shows the tax details of your house payment.</p>
<p>If you’re a self-employed person, you are eligible to pay your 4th quarter state estimated taxes in the month of December. This way, you can increase your itemizing potential.</p>
<p><strong>Proper timing can help you boost your tax refund</strong> in the next year. By timing your mortgage payments, you can improve your chance of a relatively bigger refund in the coming year.</p></div>
