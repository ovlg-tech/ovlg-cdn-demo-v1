<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>As parents and children age, the familiar family roles often switch. And for some adult children this means helping elderly parents financially. Become familiar with your parents' finances so that you can help them out if needed. If possible, begin conversations while their health and finances are still in good shape, so that you'll be able to spot any warning signals earlier. Try to help out your parents with their finances, but donâ€™t give them any false hope.</p></div>
