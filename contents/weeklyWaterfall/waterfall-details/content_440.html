    <p>A new layer of protection has been added for Californian consumers to save them from unlawful debt collection
        practices. Beginning on January 1, 2022, anyone engaged in the debt collection business in California has to be
        licensed under the <strong>Debt Collection Licensing Act (SB 908)</strong>. Licensed entities must also develop
        compliance-focused policies and procedures, maintain surety bonds, file annual reports, and undergo periodic
        examinations. The Act also amended existing state debt collection laws.</p>
    <p>The exemption will be available for some entities licensed by the <strong>California Department of Financial
            Protection and Innovation (DFPI)</strong>. The application will be available through the Nationwide
        Multistate Licensing System (“NMLS”) website. DFPI has declared that only the applicants who submit applications
        on or before December 31, 2021, may continue to operate in California while their application status is pending.
