<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>One audit notice from the IRS is enough to make you uncomfortable. It gives you a sinking feeling in the pit of your stomach and makes you breathless. Relax: it’s not an incurable disease. It’s just an examination. But before you sit for the examination, check and find out if your examiner is genuine.</p>

<p>Fake tax examinations do happen in this country. So, be very careful. Unless you receive audit notice from the IRS through a written letter, don’t give any information or make any payment promptly. IRS is less likely to contact you via phone or email. So, if you do get a call from a tax examiner, find out if he is legit. There is a great probability that he is a scammer. </p></div>
