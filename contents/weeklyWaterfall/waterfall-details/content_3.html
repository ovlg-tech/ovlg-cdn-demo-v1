    <p>Its quite easy to swipe a credit card while purchasing, but everything has its pros and cons attached to it. If
        you are able to pay bills on time every month and not carry over a balance, then credit cards can be of great
        convenience or else it will help you to land up in debt. So, its a better choice to leave your credit cards home
        while shopping.</p>
