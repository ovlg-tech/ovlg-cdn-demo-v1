<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Are you thinking about the taxes on your unemployment benefits? According to the U.S. Labor Department, you can file for unemployment benefits if you lose your job without having your fault. Besides, you have to meet other eligibility requirements set by your respective state. But if you are eligible for receiving unemployment benefits, you might have to pay taxes for it. According to the IRS, <strong>unemployment benefits are taxable income</strong>. This means that any unemployment compensation that you receive from a state or the federal government must be included in your income and will be taxed at your ordinary-income tax rate.</p>
<p>So, you can <strong>file a Form W-4V (Voluntary Withholding Request) to have federal and state (if applicable) income taxes withheld automatically from your unemployment benefits</strong> like a paycheck. Doing so, you wonâ€™t owe a relatively large tax bill when you file income taxes.</p></div>
