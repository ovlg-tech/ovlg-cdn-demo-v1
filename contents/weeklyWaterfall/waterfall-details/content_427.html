<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>You can take the help of the 'no-contest clause' while doing your estate planning if you're distributing unevenly amongst your heirs. It is also helpful when you decide to give more or less to your spouse than what he/she is supposed to receive as an heir.</p>
<p><strong>A no-contest clause restricts beneficiaries from challenging the terms of a will</strong>. Under some states' laws, such clauses are unenforceable.</p>
<p>In California, under Sections 21310-21315 of the Probate Code, these rules have become irrevocable from January 1, 2001.</p>
<p>"Section 21310 of the Probate Code recognizes three types of contests that can be the subject of a 'no-contest' clause:</p>
<p>(1) a direct contest that is brought without probable cause;</p>
<p>(2) a pleading to challenge a transfer of property on the grounds that it was not the transferor's property at the time of the transfer; and</p>
<p>(3) the filing of a creditor's claim or prosecution of an action based on it.</p>
<p>It is also known as a terrorem clause, anticontest clause, noncontest clause, and forfeiture clause.</p></div>
