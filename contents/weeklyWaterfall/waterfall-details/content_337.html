<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>If it is possible for you, do not take capital gains in December or the current financial year. As per tax calculation laws, you have to <strong>pay tax on the amount received during the financial year and not the assessment year</strong>.</p>
<p>An additional income might push you into the higher bracket. You can receive the amount in January and pay tax in the next year. It might benefit you financially. But, keep in mind, you should apply this method only when you know you will be in the same or lower tax bracket next year. Otherwise, it can hit you with a higher tax bill next year.</p></div>
