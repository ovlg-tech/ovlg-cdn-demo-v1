<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>We are going through financial hardship due to this pandemic. A huge number of people have lost their job or pay cuts. People are desperately searching for new jobs. The worst part is, <strong>scammers are taking advantage of this situation</strong>. They are applying several tricks to harass people. As per the report, they are advertising jobs and vacancies online, in newspapers, and even on TV and radio like the ways legitimate employers do. And asking for money in return before getting the job. Never be a part of it and <strong>don't share your credit card or banking details</strong>. It's a scam and you will lose your money. Take immediate action if you come across anything like this.</p>
<p>Contact the company or organizations mentioned in the advertisement personally to know about the available vacancies.</p></div>
