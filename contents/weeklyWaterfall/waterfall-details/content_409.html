<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>If you get a lawsuit against your debt, you need to respond to it immediately. It can be very risky if you delay or ignore it. It can <strong>result in wage garnishment, property seizure</strong>, or etc. In California, you will get 30 days to respond to the summons and complaint. However, the responding time varies from state to state.</p>
<p>So, if you receive anything, take immediate action and show up for the court proceeding. Otherwise, the judge will rule against you and, you have to pay the full amount claimed by the collector.</p></div>
