<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Negotiation is an effective part of your personal finances. Surprisingly, you might not believe, but it’s an art. We all know what negotiation actually is. But the question is how to negotiate in a better and more effective way.</p>

<p>If you want to be a super-negotiator, first you need to know your break even point. It’s the highest price you’re willing to pay for either a product or a service. Once you know it, you need to learn the art of negotiating. Frankly, there are no thumb rules. If you want to be a good negotiator, you need to first get out off the cocoon of your false social esteem and speak out.</p>

<p>If you don’t ask for a bargain, nobody is going to give you willingly. Everyone looks for more profit. Next, you need to know where a negotiation might work. If you go and try to negotiate for a rare art piece, you’re not going to gain anything. Yes, you’re in a better position if you negotiate while buying something that is available in greater quantities.</p>

<p>While starting, ask for a bargain that is at least 75% lower that what you actually wants to spend, and gradually take that up. Lastly, never feel rushed or show eagerness to grab the deal while you negotiate.</p></div>
