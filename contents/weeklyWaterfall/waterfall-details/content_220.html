<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>If your airline asks you to get bumped from your flight due to overbooking, don't volunteer to take the airlineâ€™s compensation. As per the federal air travel law, if you are bumped from your flight involuntarily, you would get a larger compensation (up to $1300) from that airline depending on how much of a delay was involved. </p>

<p>You would be <strong>compensated up to $650</strong> if you would get to your destination between 1-2 hours of your scheduled arrival time. You would be <strong>compensated up to $1,300</strong> if you would get to your destination over 2 hours from your scheduled arrival time or if the airline does not make any substitute travel arrangements for you.</p><br>
