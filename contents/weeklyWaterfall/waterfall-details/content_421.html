<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>To avoid falling into debt, make sure you complete and mail Form 9465, Installment Agreement Request, and Form 433-F Collection Information Statement, if you cannot pay your taxes immediately. By doing so, you can request to make your payments through installments. It will help you eliminate or lower interest and penalties, too.</p>
<p>To apply for the installment agreement you have to maintain the following steps:</p>
<p>1) Fill up Form 9465 and mail it to the IRS along with an Installment Agreement Request and the Collection Information Statement i.e. Form 433-F.</p>
<p>2) Make a phone call to the number you get on your bill or notice.</p>
<p>3) Wait for further instructions from the IRS and follow the instruction carefully.</p></div>
