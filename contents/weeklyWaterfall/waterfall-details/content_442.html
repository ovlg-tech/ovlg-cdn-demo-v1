    <p>New York City is going to be the first major US city that will require COVID-19 vaccination proof for the people
        who want to dine indoors at a restaurant, go to a gym, or an entertainment venue. This new mandate is called
        "<strong>Key to NYC Pass</strong>" and was announced last Tuesday by mayor Bill de Blasio. So far, this is the
        most aggressive step that NYC has taken to combat a surge in cases caused by the delta variant.</p>
    <p>According to Democrat, some details, including rules affecting children under 12, are still being worked out.
        "Key to NYC Pass" policy will go into effect on Aug. 16, but enforcement will begin on <strong>Sept.
            13</strong>.</p>
