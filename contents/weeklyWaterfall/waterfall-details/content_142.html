<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Didn’t check your credit report? Congratulations! You’ve just invited another trouble to your financial house.</p> 

<p>Cable channel providers and mobile service providers check your credit report when you submit your application forms. If someone has a better credit history than yours, then the service provider may charge you more than him or her. And, this is perfectly legal as long as they send you a Risk-Based Pricing Notice.</p>

<p>A Risk-Based Pricing Notice technically gives you three pieces of information - (a) you’re entitled to get a free copy of your credit report, (b) you can dispute errors on your credit report, (c) you’ve received less favorable credit terms due to your poor credit history.</p></div>
