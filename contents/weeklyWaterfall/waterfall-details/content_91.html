<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;">Are you a spender and your spouse a saver? Well, in that case, let me tell you that marriage is not only about love and commitment. There are many more things to marriage than just spending days and nights together. Both of you're at the opposite side of a spending spectrum. So, both of you need to compromise and find middle ground to avoid fights. Create a budget so that there won't be any unjustified demands. Both of you'll spend and buy things as per the demand of the family budget. And, this would prolong your newlywed bliss and happiness.</div>
