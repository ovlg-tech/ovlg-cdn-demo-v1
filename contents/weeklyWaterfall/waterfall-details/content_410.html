<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Are debt collectors harassing you on your social platforms? FDCPA has got several complaints regarding debt collector's <strong>harassment of the debtors through electronic communications like email, text messages, and social media</strong>. To protect the debtors from such a situation, CFPB has issued a significant debt collection final rule amending Regulation F, 12 CFR part 1006 on October 30, 2020. This final rule applies to harassment or abuse, false or misleading representations, and unfair practices.</p>
<p>This is one of the most effective steps to protect the debtors from the collectors. It has a direct impact on enforcement investigations, supervisory examinations, and litigation. So, if you're facing any harassment, take legal steps.</p></div>
