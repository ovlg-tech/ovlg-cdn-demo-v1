<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Are you suffering from heart problems due to rampant debt collection calls? If so, then consult a doctor immediately. Once done, <b>go to a FDCPA attorney</b> and report your health problems caused due to incessant debt collection calls. If it is proved that the debt collector is responsible for your poor health conditions, then <b>you can get $1000</b> from him.</p> 

<p>Similarly, if you're stressed or depressed <b>due to invasion of privacy</b>, and the debt collector is responsible for it, then also you can get $1000 from him. Just document everything to the FDCPA attorney.</p></div>
