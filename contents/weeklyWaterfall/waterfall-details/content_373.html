<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Are you aware of the new SECURE Act that came into effect on January 1, 2020? It has made a lot of changes to the existing retirement plan contribution and distribution rules. As per the new rules, individuals who are older than 70 1/2, may not contribute to the traditional IRA. But, the age will rise to 72 for those who have not yet attained age 70 1/2 by December 31, 2019. The new law has allowed penalty-free distributions from retirement accounts for expenses on the birth or adoption of a child. You can also <strong>get up to $100,000 for expenses related to disasters that occurred after 2017 and before February 18, 2020</strong>.</p>
<p>So, take advantage of the new laws and enjoy your retirement days.</p></div>
