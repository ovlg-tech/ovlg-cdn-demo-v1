    <p>This year, did you file for a tax extension? Keep an eye out for <strong>October 15</strong> to prevent further
        penalties.
        You can opt for IRS electronic filing options if you want. Failure to meet the deadline can subject you to late
        filing penalties. Alternatively, you may also owe an additional interest or may be liable to pay a higher
        late-payment penalty.</p>
    <p>The IRS advises taxpayers to file electronically as it's the safest and quickest way to get a refund. Because
        this way, the refunds can be transferred straight into your bank or other financial accounts. You can file now
        and schedule a tax payment through the IRS2Go app until the October 15 deadline.</p>
    <p>Even though October 15 is the last tax filing date, some people may have more time to file their tax returns,
        like military personnel in combat zones or people living in federally declared disaster areas. Everyone else
        must file their taxes by October 15.</p>
