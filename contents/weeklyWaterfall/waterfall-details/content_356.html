<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Have you exceeded your credit card limit? Pay it within the time limit or get ready to pay a higher amount. The penalty fee has increased. According to The Truth in Lending Act (TILA), the penalty has <strong>increased from $28 to $29 for the first offense and $39 instead of $38 for the second time</strong>.</p>
<p>If you think that the difference is only $1, then you're making a mistake. This $1 can result in your future. Always try to pay your credit card bills on time and never exceed the card set amount.</p></div>
