<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Missouri lawmakers have changed the pdl laws. As per the current law, pdl borrowers can renew loans for at least 6 times. The minimum loan term is of 14 days and a maximum of 31 days. No borrower shall be required to pay a total amount of accumulated interest and fees in excess of 75% of the initial loan amount on any single loan. The new law eliminates rollovers and caps the fees at 35%. That is why you need to keep a watch on the Missouri lawmakers.</p></div>
