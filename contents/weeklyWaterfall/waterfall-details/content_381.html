<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Are you afraid that you might have to leave your rented house due to non-payment during this pandemic? Have you got any eviction notice or extra charges from the landlord?</p>
<p>Don't worry!! You won't be evicted and pay any extra charges during this pandemic. According to CARES Act #4024(b) during the 120-day period beginning on the Act’s March 27, 2020 enactment date (until July 25, 2020), <strong>the lessor of a “covered dwelling” may not file a court action for eviction and also prohibits from charging fees, penalties, or other charges to the tenant related to such nonpayment of rent</strong>. As per 4024(C) even after this said period the lessor cannot require the tenant to vacate until it gives the tenant a thirty-day notice to quit.</p></div>
