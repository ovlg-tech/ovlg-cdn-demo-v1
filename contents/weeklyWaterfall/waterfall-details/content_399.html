<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Sometimes we find misinformation on our credit report. In such a situation, we have to inform the credit bureaus to rectify the mistakes. To protect us from this kind of situation, we have The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). It is a federal act and it regulates credit reporting agencies. This act <strong>forces the credit bureaus to gather and distribute a fair and accurate report</strong> to the consumer.</p>
<p>This law is also applicable to the banks, credit unions, and agencies that sell medical records or check writing or rental history records, and the businesses that use the information on credit reports for hiring purposes. So, if you face anything like this, you can take advantage of this law.</p></div>
