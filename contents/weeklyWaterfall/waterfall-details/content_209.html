<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>54.8% Americans celebrated Valentine’s Day, and they spent $1.98 billion for flowers in 2016. The figure is huge and also saddening. Have you ever thought that instead of spending such a huge amount on Roses, you can use the money <strong>to give a debt-free life to your loved one?</strong></p> 

<p>Statistics show that an average <strong>consumer spent $147 on Valentine’s Day</strong>. A dozen roses <strong>usually costs around $42 and the cost may rise to $100 on Rose Day and Valentine's Day</strong>.</p> 

<p>If you love somebody, then <strong>use $147 to pay some of her/his bills</strong>. At least, it would help to bring a positive change in his/her life. He or she would appreciate this token of love more than a rose.</p></div>
