    <p><strong>Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)</strong> is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that destroys the
        brain and spinal cord nerve cells. Sadly, this condition has no recognized cure. So, govt. financial assistance
        helps these individuals to prolong their lives by focusing on what matters most.</p>
    <p>The <strong>ALS Disability Insurance Access Act of 2019</strong> was signed into law by the president last
        December. In March 2021, the president signed <strong>S 579</strong> into public law <strong>117-3</strong> to
        make a technical correction to the ALS Disability Insurance Access Act of 2019. S 579 has eliminated the
        five-month waiting period for the Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) benefits for ALS individuals
        approved on or after July 23, 2020.</p>
    <p>The rapid and severe course of ALS robs people of their careers and employer-based insurance during their most
        difficult times. Unlike some other rare diseases, this disease does not reverse course. Hence the waiting period
        used to impede ALS individuals' access to a financial lifeline. Thanks to the current law, they can now bypass
        it successfully.</p>
