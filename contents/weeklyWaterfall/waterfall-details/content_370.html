<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Are you wondering how to pay for bankruptcy when you don't have money? Well, you may be able to get the filing fees for Chapter 7 bankruptcy waived by the courts. In order to qualify for this, the bankruptcy law states that <strong>you must have a combined family income of less than 150% of the poverty line</strong>. The court will mail you if you qualify for the waiver.</p>
<p>Attorney fees are the most expensive part of the bankruptcy. They do not ask for any upfront fees. They will suggest you an instalment scheme paying in four payments within 120 days of filing bankruptcy.</p></div>
