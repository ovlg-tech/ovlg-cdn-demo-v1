<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Don't be ashamed of your parents don’t have a bachelor's degree. Rather, be happy about it if you're applying for the FAFSA.</p>

<p>Yes, you can save money on your college degree when your parents don’t have one. Some colleges and states <strong>give extra aid to students whose parents haven't studied after high school</strong>. Watch out for those colleges and states.</p> 

<p>Be careful when you’re filling out the college aid form. Fill in the dot only for <strong>"high school" when you’re answering questions 24 and 25</strong>.</p></div>
