<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Keep your car at garage and get a bike to ride to office daily. While this will keep you fit, this will also save you money on gas and fitness club fees. If your car is just a few miles away from your home, you can definitely think about riding down to office. Perhaps the journey will take time, but you forgot that you’re already saving some by not working out.</p>

<p>Use the car only when you’re traveling with family or friends. Otherwise, it’s simply waste of money and resources if you’re traveling all alone in a car that can accommodate 4 persons.</p></div>
