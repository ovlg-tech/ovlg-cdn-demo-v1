<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>If you're a smoker and staying in New Jersey, then you have to avoid smoking on the beaches and public parks. New Jersey Gov. signed a  <strong>"Smoked-Free Air Act" (SB-2534)  that strictly bans smoking in the beaches and public parks</strong>. Violation of this rule will cost you <strong>$250 for the first time, a $500 fine for the second offense and $1000 for the future violations</strong>.</p>
<p>The "Smoked-Free  Air Act" is already applicable to indoor public places and workplaces.  The law didn't state who will enforce the law, rather the government believes that the enforcement of this law would come from the person "at the point of attack". So, it's better to avoid smoking in these places,  it'll help you to save money and your health too.</p></div>
