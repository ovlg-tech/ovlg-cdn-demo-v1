<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>The new debt collection law in West Virginia prohibits debt collectors from calling consumers more than 30 times a week. In fact, they canâ€™t get into telephonic conversation more than 10 times in any week. If any debt collector violates this law, then consumers can file a lawsuit at the court and recover approximately $1000 (for extra damages) for violation. </p></div>
