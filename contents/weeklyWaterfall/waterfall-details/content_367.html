<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Are you getting annoying telemarketing calls from your area code? You can restrict those calls by filing a complaint of spoofing.</p>
<p>According to the Texas Telemarketing Disclosure and Privacy Act (HB 1992), from now on, <strong>telemarketers will no longer be able to manipulate Caller ID</strong>. Earlier, the telemarketers were capable of changing the number that shows up to match the same area code you use. As a result, you used to think the call was coming from your neighborhood. Now, anyone who puts fake information on a Caller ID is subject to get a penalty for this.</p></div>
