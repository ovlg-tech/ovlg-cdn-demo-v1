    <p>Are you looking for low-cost alternatives to your prescribed medications? Here's good news for you!</p>
    <p><strong>SB 0537</strong> was recently signed into law by Maryland's governor and came into effect on
        <strong>October 1, 2021</strong>. This regulation mandates that pharmacists or their designees, under certain
        conditions, inform their customers of the available, lower-cost alternatives to the prescription initially
        provided. Customers must also be informed about the pricing difference between a therapeutically equivalent drug
        and a specific prescribed drug. </p>
    <p>SB 0537 would also compel pharmacists to retain a record or provide notice demonstrating that clients were
        informed (verbally or in writing) that the mentioned generic product is equivalent to the brand name product at
        the time of purchase. This law covers not just prescription pharmaceuticals but also medical equipment that are
        prescribed.</p>
