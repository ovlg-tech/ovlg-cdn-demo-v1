<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Do you want to increase your credit score by more than 30 points in the next 6 months? Do you feel that this is just a wild dream you can never achieve? If yes, then don’t worry. Nothing is impossible in life. All you need to do is pay down your credit card balance. It would help you drop the credit utilization ratio. Next, pay off your collection accounts as soon as possible. You can either pay the full amount or you can just settle the collection accounts.</p>

<p>Make sure you don’t lose any extra point from your current credit score. This you can do by making timely payments, reducing your credit card usage and not opening new accounts.</p></div>
