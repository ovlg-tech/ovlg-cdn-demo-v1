<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Do you want to get a discharge from all of your debts even if you don’t remember all of them? File a Chapter 7 No Asset Bankruptcy case and get a discharge from all of your debts, regardless of whether or not you listed them. However, the debt should have existed prior to the date you filed the bankruptcy case.</p>
<p>As per the bankruptcy law, if you fail to list your debts, it will impact you in Chapter 13 or Chapter 11 case, <strong>but not in a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy case</strong>.</p>
<p>In the Ninth Circuit, in a “no asset” case (where no assets are liquidated and distributed by the Trustee), the failure to include a creditor and thereby provide the notice of, will have no effect on the dischargeability of the debts.</p>
<p>However, any of your creditors can reopen the case to litigate mentioning that they didn’t receive the bankruptcy notice and therefore, couldn’t file an objection within the required period.</p></div>
