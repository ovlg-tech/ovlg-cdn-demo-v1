<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Have you filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy and forgot to include a creditor? Are you worried about the result? Don't worry, <strong>it hardly matters in case of Chapter 7 bankruptcy</strong>. It has zero effect on the discharge of the debt. But, if you make the same mistake with Chapter 11 and Chapter 13, you will face some problems. You have to list all the creditors to file a claim to be paid off.</p>
<p>In Chapter 7 bankruptcy, once you receive a discharge you are free from all the debts that existed against you. But, if any of the unlisted creditors want, they can object to the discharge and can ask the court to reopen the case. You don't need to panic in such a situation. Chapter 7 cases are normally "no-asset" cases unless you make any major mistake in the filing.</p></div>
