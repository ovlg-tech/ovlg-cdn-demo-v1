<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Take advantage of The Fair Credit Billing Act (FCBA) if you find any billing errors like charges with wrong date or amount, for the goods or services that were not delivered, calculation errors, and for which you've requested an explanation. You have <strong>60 days time since you receive the credit card bill to dispute a charge</strong> with the card issuer. Remember, the charge has to be more than $50 have been made within 100 miles of the card holder's mailing address to be eligible for the dispute.</p>
<p>The card issuer must acknowledge the receipt of the complaint within 30 days and they will get two billing circles for the investigation. During that time, the issuers are <strong>not allowed to collect the payment or charge an interest or report the credit bureaus</strong> as miss payment.</p>
<p>So, if you find the card issuer violating the FCBA Act, lodge a complaint against them in the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau or the Federal Trade Commission.</p></div>
