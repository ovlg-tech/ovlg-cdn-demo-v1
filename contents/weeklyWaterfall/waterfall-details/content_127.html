<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Got call from a debt collector regarding your grandchild’s debt? Did the debt collector ask you to wire money immediately to save your grandchild’s job? Have you been told that your grandchild would be arrested if you don’t pay the money instantly?

<br><br>Don’t get emotional and wire the money instantly. First of all, you’re not liable for your grand child’s debt unless you co-signed on a loan. So, debt collectors can’t force you to pay money. Secondly, debt collectors can’t threaten you in any way. Neither can they force you to give your credit card number. So whenever you get these calls, hang up and file a complaint with the FTC.</p></div>
