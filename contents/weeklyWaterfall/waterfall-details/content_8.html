    <p>Valentineâ€™s Day is advancing. So, on this occasion plan something different, which will make both your Valentine
        and your pocket happy. Instead of buying gifts from stores, try to make hand-made stuffs and give them as a
        present. If you are still thinking, then let me remind you that hand-made gifts have a more emotional touch than
        those ready-made gifts. So, hurry and make this day memorable for your someone special!</p>
