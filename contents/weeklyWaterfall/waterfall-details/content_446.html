<p>Hawaii signed bill <strong>H.B 1192</strong> on payday lending last June to cap the maximum payday loan interest rate and make it mandatory for the licensed lender to offer installment loans instead of traditional single pay off the payday loan. This law is going to take effect on Jan. 1, 2022.</p>
<p>These installment loans will be provided by the licensed payday loan lenders regulated by the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs. These loans will have low-interest rates and fees, more flexible repayment plans, and greater transparency. Under the new law, these small-dollar consumer loans can amount up to $1500 and will be repayable over two to 12 months (depending on the size of the loan) rather than the typical two weeks. Although the interest rate on payday loans is capped to 36%, lenders may charge a monthly fee of up to $35, depending on the loan amount.</p>
<p>After approving this new payday loan reform measure, Hawaii is now one of three states (along with Illinois and Nebraska) that has recently adopted such legislation.</p>
