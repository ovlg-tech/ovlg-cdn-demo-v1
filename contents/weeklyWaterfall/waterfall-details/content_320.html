<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Have you lost your dear ones and the creditors are harassing you to pay off the deceased debt? Law is with you. As per the <strong>Credit Card Act of 2009, the creditors can't force you a speedy repayment</strong>. You'll get enough time to pay it off.</p>
<p>If you’re the executor of the estate, ask the <strong>credit card issuer to inform you about the total balance within 30 days of making a request</strong>. In the interim, the meter can't keep running, so no late fees or annual fees can be imposed when you’re settling debts. If you want to save money, try to pay off debts as soon as you get the intimation of the credit card balance. Creditors will charge additional interest rates once the 30-day period is over.</p></div>
