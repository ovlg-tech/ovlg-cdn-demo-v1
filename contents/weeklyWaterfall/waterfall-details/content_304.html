<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>If you file a Chapter 11 Bankruptcy, <strong>make sure you seek authorization from the bankruptcy court to use a portion of the cash collateral</strong>. Otherwise, you won’t be able to use the cash collateral (11 U.S.C. § 363. Section 363) that includes securities, deposit accounts, cash equivalents along with cash, that the debtor has pledged as security to the lender.</p>
<p>Usually, you need to make an application to use the amount (often quite a big amount), within a few days of Chapter 11 Bankruptcy filing. <strong>The bankruptcy court may agree to the proposal within 30 days of the bankruptcy filing</strong>. So, don't panic if you're in a financial emergency. Apply to the court as soon as possible and you may get the approval.</p></div>
