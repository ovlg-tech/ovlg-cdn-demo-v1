<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>FICO has introduced a new credit scoring system called Ultrafico in 2019. Earlier, people with bad credit or with no credit used to face difficulties in building their credit or getting a loan. But, the new <strong>UltraFICO score gives you the opportunity to raise up your credit score</strong>. This scoring method will analyze your saving and spending patterns and will generate a score accordingly. Let's check out the scoring system:</p>
<ul>
<li>For how long you're maintaining your bank accounts.</li>
<li>Your habits of savings and keeping an average balance.</li>
<li>Whether you had a negative balance in your account.</li>
<li>Your regularity in paying bills and other banking transactions.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, if you want a higher Ultracredit score, follow the above-mentioned points.</p></div>
