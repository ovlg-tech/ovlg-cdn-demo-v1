<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Are you thinking about filing for bankruptcy or already filed one? Here's a piece of good news for you. <strong>President Biden has enacted COVID-19 Bankruptcy Relief Extension Act on (H.R 1651) on 27th March to extend provisions providing financially distressed consumers and small businesses greater access to bankruptcy relief</strong>.</p>
<p>For the individual consumers who are filing (filed) for chapter 7 or 13, federal COVID-19 relief-related payments won't be considered income. Also, the calculation of disposable income to confirm a chapter 13 plan will not include coronavirus-related payments. In chapter 13, you can modify your payment plan if you face any financial hardship due to pandemics.</p></div>
