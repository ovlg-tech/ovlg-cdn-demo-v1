<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Did you face an accident and accumulate huge medical debt due to drunk driving? Or, did you hit anyone under the influence of alcohol and the person sent you a huge medical bill for his treatment. Do you think you can discharge these debts in bankruptcy? <strong>Sorry, your debt is not dischargeable.</strong></p>
<p>According to the bankruptcy code U.S.C. §523(a)(9), Debts arising from death or personal injury caused by the debtor’s operation of a motor vehicle while intoxicated can be held non-dischargeable.</p>
<p>As per the law, "A discharge under section 727, 1141, 1228(a), 1228(b), or 1328(b) of this title does not discharge an individual debtor from any debt — . . . for death or personal injury caused by the debtor’s operation of a motor vehicle, vessel, or aircraft if such operation was unlawful because the debtor was intoxicated from using alcohol, a drug, or another substance."</p>
<p>So, be careful and <strong>don't drive while you're drunk</strong>. It'll help your pocket as well as your health. </p></div>
