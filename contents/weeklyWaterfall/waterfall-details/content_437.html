    <p>Suffering from mental health disorder but hesitant to seek medical help due to the out-of-pocket cost? You can now get insurance coverage for most of the mental health issues.</p>
    <p>On Sept 25, 2020, <strong>SB 855</strong> has been signed into <strong>The New Parity Law</strong>, expanding insurance coverage for medically necessary treatment for all recognized mental health and substance abuse disorders. This applies to the fully insured health plans issued, amended, or renewed on or after Jan 1, 2021. The new legislation also requires the insurance plan to ensure that medically necessary out-of-network services and any necessary follow-up services are provided at the same cost-sharing level as in-network services. Before this, it was very difficult for people to access affordable, preventive behavioral health care, forcing them to opt for treatment only when they reach the crisis point.</p>
    <p>However, now they don't need to wait that long and can opt for treatment at the primary stage. The law is a significant step forward in the fight for health care parity, treating mental health services in the same manner as physical health services.</p>
