<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Coping with the death of a loved one is difficult enough without the added pressure of creditors calling you to collect on the deceased person’s debts. Creditors don’t have the right to compel family members and relatives to pay off a deceased person’s debt. So, if you are getting calls regarding inherited debts, its high time that you should contact an attorney as you are not responsible for such debts.</p></div>
