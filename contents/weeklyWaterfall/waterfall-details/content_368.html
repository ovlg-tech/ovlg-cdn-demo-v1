<p>According to the new state law in <strong>Dallas as per Senate Bill 2342, the threshold of a case jumps to $20,000 from $10,000</strong>. It will most probably come into <strong>effect in September 2020</strong>. With the increasing inflation, it becomes tougher to bring cases in small claims. To encourage people the amount has been doubled as the last change was made around 20 years ago.</p></div>
