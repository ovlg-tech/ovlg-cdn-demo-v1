<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>A bad check is what the bank never pays on. <strong>Writing a bad check is very risky</strong> and it can lead to huge bank fees. If you do this repeatedly, it can be a reason for imprisonment or legal troubles or you can lose the right to write any further checks, even, it can affect your credit.</p>
<p>So if you want to avoid such situations, keep an eye on your checking account. If you don't have enough balance in your account and you have already written a check, then <strong>talk to your bank to stop or hold the check</strong>. Put some money on the account and give a green signal to the bank to clear the check. You have to be extremely careful while writing a check to avoid any legal issue.</p></div>
