All you need to do is set aside at least 50% of your pay hike for your savings account. If you wish, you can keep it in your retirement savings account as well. But do ensure that you’re getting employer’s retirement match as well. It’s totally free money. Don’t give up your chance to accelerate your savings.</p></div>
