<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>As long as your finances are concerned, does your plan A always work? What if it fails someday? Do you keep a plan B as standby or backup?</p>

<p>If you don’t, make a habit of keeping a plan B always in place from today onwards. What would be your option if you put up a fund for your kid’s college education, and lose it due to a crisis just days before the admission?</p>

<p>This is where a plan B comes in help. If there is already another fund in place, or a source where you could get the money from as per your plan B, the admission process will go smoothly.</p></div>
