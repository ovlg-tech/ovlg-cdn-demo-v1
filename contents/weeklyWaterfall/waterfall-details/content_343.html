<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Often debt collectors file lawsuits to scare consumers or garnish their wages. They drop their cases after the consumers challenge the lawsuit. Unfortunately, the damage has been done by that time. Once wages have been garnished, the debt gets revived instantly. Even a <strong>small payment is enough to revive time-barred debts</strong>. Hence, consumers are forced to settle or consolidate time-barred debts.</p>
<p>Texas and Washington state have passed legislation this year making it more difficult to revive debt past its statute of limitations. <strong>So, if you're sued for a debt or asked to make a payment on the debt, ignore it</strong>. The law is on your side. Even if you make a payment, then also the debt won't be revived. It's a big change. Take advantage of it.
