    <p>One of the most recent updates in the student loan sector is the <strong>Student Loan Borrower “bill of rights"</strong>. <strong>Assembly Bill 376</strong> has been enacted as part of a package of consumer protection legislation.</p>
    <p>This new rule will protect student loan borrowers by prohibiting abusive and unlawful student loan servicing practices such as wrongfully driving borrowers into forbearance and taking away relief programs like income-driven repayment. It will also prohibit unfair practices like inaccurate credit reporting, denying communication with the borrower’s authorized representative, and falsifying reports to the DBO or other government agencies. If a borrower suffers damages caused by a lender evading standards or participating in “unfair or deceptive practises,” the law outlines how the borrower can seek legal action. As per the law, starting from July 1, California has to establish a new Student Loan Ombudsman to oversee the industry.</p>
