<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Did you turn 62 in 2016? If so, then there's a bad news for you. From 2016 onwards, you can <strong>claim Social Security payments either for your spouse or for yourself</strong>. Earlier, you could collect spousal payments first and later for yourself based on your own work. The biggest advantage of doing this thing is that you could receive higher payment since it is being claimed at an older age.</p>

<p>As per the new law, you can claim double Social Security payments at the age of 66.</p></div>
