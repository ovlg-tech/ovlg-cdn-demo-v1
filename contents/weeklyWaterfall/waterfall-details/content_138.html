<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>The country is all set to embrace EMV technology wherein microchips will be on the front of credit cards. From October 1, 2015, you need to dip your credit cards instead of swiping them. As soon as you dip your credit card, the chip will generate an unique transaction code. No one can use this code for the second time, which will reduce the chances of scams.</p>

<p>If you haven’t yet received new credit cards, then it’s time to watch out for them.</p></div>
