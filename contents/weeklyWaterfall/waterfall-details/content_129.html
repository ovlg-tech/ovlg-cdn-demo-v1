<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Giveaway contests in social media are alluring since you get a chance to win attractive prizes just by participating in the online contest. But are these really as good as what they promise to be? It depends.</p>

<p>While some contests are really good, the same thing can’t be said about rest of the others since they’re mostly scams. Here is an useful tip to spot these scams:</p>

<p>At some point, you’ll be requested to provide your bank account details or PIN number for participating in the contest. Once you get such a request, just log out from the web page since it’s a scam.</p>

Let me explain how this scam actually works: 

Once you give your bank account details, the scammers will deposit several checks one by one. Thereafter, they’ll withdraw all money from your checking account before the bank realizes that these checks are phony.</div>
