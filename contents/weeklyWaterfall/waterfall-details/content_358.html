<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Have you just signed up a contract with a credit repair company but not sure whether you should go with it? Or, did your credit repair company refuse to cancel the deal (or asking for a hefty fee) because you have already signed the contract with them?</p>
<p>Don't worry! As per the Credit Repair Organizations Act (SEC. 407), the credit repair company must give you a <strong>"cooling off" period of 3 days before performing any services for you</strong>. You can <strong>cancel the contract without any penalty or obligation before midnight of the 3rd business day</strong>. If you cancel within that period there won't be any cancellation fee and the contract won't be enforced too.</p></div>
