<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p><strong>Social Security income is beneficial</strong> during your retirement years. But, if you’re not careful, then you can end up paying tax on your Social Security income. If you’re married and filing jointly, then try to keep your combined income low. If <strong>your combined income is between $32,000 and $44,000, then only 50% of your Social Security benefits will be taxed</strong>.</p> 

<p>If your combined income is above $44,000, then your benefits can be taxed up to 85%.</p></div>
