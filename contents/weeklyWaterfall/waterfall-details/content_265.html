<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Are you raising a child with special needs? If so, then you can use the tax strategies other than Child &amp; Dependent Care Tax Credit to give your wallet a relief. A special child needs little bit extra attention, a special diet of gluten-free, casein-free foods. These foods are costly and it's not easy to maintain on a regular basis.</p>

<p>IRS gives you the opportunity to use these foods as a deduction provided it is medically recommended. The additional cost of the foods over and above what would be paid for similar items are deductible. You just need to <strong>attach a letter from the doctor to your tax returns</strong> that match your claim.</p></div>
