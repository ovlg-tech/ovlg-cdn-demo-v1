<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>You do not have to pay taxes on debts that are wiped out in bankruptcy. Unlike debts that are consolidated or forgiven by a creditor, debts that are discharged in a bankruptcy are not subject to being taxed. If you want to avoid paying tax on cancelled debt, file bankruptcy.</p></div>
