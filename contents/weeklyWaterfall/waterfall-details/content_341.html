<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Are you a veteran and planning to file for bankruptcy? Then, you must know the bankruptcy laws. When you receive disability from your Social Security, it won't be counted as your income. But, when you receive a disability check from the military, then it'll be counted in the Means Test. If your overall income becomes high, you might be forced to file for Chapter 13, not Chapter 7. In that case, you have to pay some of your debts that can be discharged in Chapter 7.</p>
<p>So, think first before making any decision. <strong>Don't file bankruptcy instantly</strong>. Try to <a href="https://www.ovlg.com/debt-settlement">settle your debts</a> or consolidate them instead.</p></div>
