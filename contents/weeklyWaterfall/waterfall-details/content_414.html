<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>The debt collectors must send a communication (oral or in writing) about the debt to the consumer before reporting it to the credit reporting agency. If that communication is in writing (traditional or electronic), the debt collector must wait at least 14 days to ensure there are no deliverability issues. Once the 14 days, they are allowed to report it to the credit report agency.</p>
<p>As per the Final Rule, issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), debt collectors have to restrict themselves from such practices. If you face anything like this in the future, you can report it or take legal actions.</p></div>
