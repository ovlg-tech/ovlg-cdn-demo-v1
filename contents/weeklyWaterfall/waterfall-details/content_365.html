<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Have you filed for bankruptcy recently? If so, then don't make a plan to buy a car. You have to <strong>wait till your Chapter 7 bankruptcy is discharged</strong>. Otherwise, itâ€™ll be difficult for you to finance a vehicle. The lenders might not approve someone with an open Chapter 7 bankruptcy.</p>
<p>In Chapter 7 bankruptcy, it <strong>takes only 3-6 months to get relief from the debts</strong>. So, it's better to wait for that tenure than to get rejected from the lenders.</p></div>
