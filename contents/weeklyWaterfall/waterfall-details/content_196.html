<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Are you being harassed by your creditor? Have you been treated unfairly because of your age, sex color, relationship status, national status or age? If so, then donâ€™t feel disheartened. Take advantage of the <a href="https://www.ovlg.com/education/us-labor-laws-highlights-of-the-major-worker-welfare-acts.html">Equal Credit Opportunity Act or the ECOA</a>.</p> 


<p>This Act prohibits creditors from discriminating people on the factors like marital status, gender, race, caste, etc. If any creditor refuses to give you a loan because of any of these factors, then <strong>report to the Federal Trade Commission</strong>.</p></div>
