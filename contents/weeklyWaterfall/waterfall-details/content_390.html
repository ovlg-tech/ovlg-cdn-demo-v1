<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Good news for small businesses. Earlier, the <strong>FDCPA didn’t apply to small business/commercial accounts or to creditors attempting to collect their own debts</strong>. But, as per the Small Business and Consumer Debt Collection Emergency Relief Act of 2020 (Senate Bill No. 3565), there are several far-reaching amendments to the Fair Debt Collections Practices Act, 15 U.S.C. 1692, et. seq. (“FDCPA”). According to Section, 3(b) of the Bill, debt collectors or creditors can not engage in many acts concerning consumer and small business debt.</p>
<p>Some of which are:</p>
<p> 1.Capitalize unpaid interest;</p>
<p> 2. Increase the interest on debt following non-payment of debt;</p>
<p> 3. Charge a fee as the result of non-payment of debt;</p>
<p> 4. Sue or threaten to sue as the result of non-payment of debt;</p>
<p> 5. Submit a confession of judgment to any court to the debt.</p>
<p>So, if you find any unlawful practices, take legal steps against the debt collectors or creditors.</p></div>
