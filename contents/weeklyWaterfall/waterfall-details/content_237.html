<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Call your electricity provider to find out how they charge you. Some electricity companies have different rates for the peak and off-peak hours. The off-peak hours usually start from 10pm to 10am everyday. The cost of electricity and usage are very low in the off-peak period. Try to use electricity in this period to save money.</p></div>
