<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Legally, you're not responsible for your demised spouse's unpaid debt. But, to avoid any financial obligation, you have to make sure that your spouse's debts are handled properly and your credit is unaffected. You have to monitor your spouse's accounts closely and if you have any joint accounts, you have to take some immediate steps.</p>
<p>1) You have to inform the lenders about the accounts held in your spouse's name should be closed. In the case of joint accounts, notify the lenders about the death of one party.</p>
<p>2) Inform at least one major credit reporting agency about the death of your spouse. They will inform the other agencies accordingly.</p>
<p>Debt doesn't end up with the death of a person but it doesn't mean you are responsible to pay off the debts. It gets paid from their estate.</p></div>
