<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>The stimulus payments have given us much relief during this pandemic.  But, few people are worried about the taxes they have to pay next year for this money. Don't worry! We don't have to pay a single penny for these payments. As per the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, we'll get $1200 for each adult and $500 for per dependent child. The <strong>stimulus checks do not come under state or federal income tax</strong> and this income will never be considered as your taxable income, this is an advance on a federal tax credit.</p>
<p>It's a tough time, job loss, the economic slowdown, that can hamper our financial and family life. Make the best use of the money to live a better life.</p></div>
