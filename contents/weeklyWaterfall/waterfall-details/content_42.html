<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>When you buy a home in the U.S., you receive a bank loan that you have to pay back within 15 or 30 years. Most people choose the 30-year loan because the monthly payments are lower and also because it lets them buy a more expensive house. The average rate on a 15 year mortgage offers a pretty significant savings over the 30 year loan. But, payments are much larger on 15 year deals because the debt has to get paid off twice as fast. So, it is solely your decision which one to select.</p></div>
