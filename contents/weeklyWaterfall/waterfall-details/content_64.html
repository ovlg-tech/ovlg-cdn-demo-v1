<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>If you cannot pay your debts and are receiving calls from collectors demanding payment or, if you are dealing with a lawsuit, bankruptcy may help you. One of the major aims of bankruptcy law is to give a financially distressed person an opportunity to make a new financial start. Filing bankruptcy generally results in the "discharge" or release from obligation of your debts or at least of many of them, so that no further legal action can ever be taken against you on those debts. In short, bankruptcy gives you a fresh start. However, you should be careful before filing for bankruptcy because doing so, may affect your credit and have other adverse consequences.</p></div>
