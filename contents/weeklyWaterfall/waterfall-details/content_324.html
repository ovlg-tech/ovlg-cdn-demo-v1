<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Timing is everything! It's always suggested to file for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in the month when you receive some extra income. For example, if you plan to file for Chapter 13 and you know you'll receive some extra money next month, then file Chapter 13 in the next month.  Because this <strong>extra income won't be calculated as your income</strong> and you can save the money. Only the <strong>last 6 months income will be calculated</strong> and not the current month.</p>
<p>So, if you want to save the extra money, file for Chapter 13 bankruptcy only on that month when you receive the money.</p></div>
