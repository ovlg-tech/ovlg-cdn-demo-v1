<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Do you feel you're being discriminated for your sexual orientation by your employer or potential employer? If so, you can take help of Federal law. According to the law, <strong>an employer can not discriminate the employees on the basis of gender or gender identity, sexual orientation, and pregnancy</strong>.</p>
<p>You can file a case if you think you’re being discriminated, as you’re a lesbian or gay, in your workplace. <strong>You can get compensation of about $40,000</strong> if you opt for out of court settlement. The law and compensation are more or less similar to that of gender discrimination law and compensation.</p></div>
