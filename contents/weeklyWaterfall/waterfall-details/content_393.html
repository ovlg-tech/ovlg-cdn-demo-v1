<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>A piece of very good news is waiting for all of us. As per the proposed law, the HEALS Act, it is illegal if debt collectors seize your stimulus checks any more because of federal, state, or private debt. The only exception is the past-due child support debt.</p>
<p>If the HEALS Act becomes law then it will be beneficial for us. The individuals earning less than $75,000 and couples earning less than $150,000 per year, will <strong>get a check of $1200 and $2400 respectively</strong>. Along with that, we can <strong>get another $500 for the dependent regardless of their age</strong>. The best part is that the debt collectors can not seize the stimulus checks for paying off debts.</p></div>
