<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>The IRS won’t let you flee if your taxes remain unpaid. If you <strong>don’t pay your tax, the IRS may notify the State Department about it</strong>. And, in this scenario, the state department won't give you a new passport or renew your old passport. The IRS has not yet begun notifying tax debt to the State Department. But, it will <strong>start in early 2017</strong>. The official website of the IRS will soon be updated to inform when the process has been implemented.</p>

<p>Clear all your tax debts by April if you want to travel freely across the world. Remember, once the IRS notifies about your tax debt to the State Government, it will be tough to get a grip over the situation.</p>

<p>The State government will keep your application for 90 days before denying a passport. In these 90 days, you can: </p>
<ul>
<li>Pay off the tax debt in full</li>
<li>Arrange an alternative payment plan with the IRS </li>
<li>Resolve errors </li>
</ul></div>
