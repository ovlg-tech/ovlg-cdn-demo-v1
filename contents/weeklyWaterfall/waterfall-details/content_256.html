<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>It's a very effective way to save on water and water bills. Take a plastic bottle, put some sands or pebbles or stones, and fill it with water. Then, place it in your toilet water tank. Less water will be required to fill up the tank and each time, you can <strong>save at least 1 to 2 gallons</strong>. Now, calculate how much money you can save in a year? It's <strong>not less than $100</strong>.</p>

<p>Just keep in mind two simple things. First, you have to select the size of your bottle according to your water tank and secondly, place the bottle in such a way that it never touches the working parts of the toilet. So, try it and start saving water and your wallet.</p></div>
