<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Being in debt can be a stressful experience. To get out of debt, you need a plan and you need to execute that plan. Many people try to get out of debt, but life slaps them on the face hard enough that they give up. Getting out of debt and then staying out of debt are not easy. Here are some guidelines which you should follow to get out of debt - make a conscious decision and stop borrowing money; establish an emergency fund of $1000; keep a record and categorize your spending; make a budget based on your spending record; make a list of all your debts, creditor’s name, interest rate, balance minimum monthly payment; also make a list of the three-year payment for each debt as found on credit card statements and remember to include loans that are not listed on your credit reports for example, family loans, medical bills and lastly, don’t give up. You didn't get into debt and you won’t get out of debt in a day. Quick fixes don't last, but learning how to manage your money can bring great peace into your life.</p></div>
