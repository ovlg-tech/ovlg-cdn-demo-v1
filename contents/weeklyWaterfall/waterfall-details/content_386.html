<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>A financial crisis is all around, everyone is struggling, especially those who have filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy recently. If you're facing the same, then you can get help through CARES Act. As per the law, you can <strong>ask the bankruptcy court to extend your Chapter 13 payment plan to 7 years</strong>.</p>
<p>The CARES Act also amends a few provisions under Chapter 13 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. This will help consumers who are facing financial hardship by the COVID-19 pandemic. So, if you have existing confirmed plans and suffering from <strong>“material financial hardship”</strong> due to COVID-19, then you will be allowed to seek plan modifications, including extending payments for up to 7 years after the first plan payment was due, and you can reduce your monthly payment obligation.</p></div>
