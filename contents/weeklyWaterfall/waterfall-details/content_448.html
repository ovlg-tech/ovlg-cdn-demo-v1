    <p>In April, New York allocated $2.1 billion from its state budget to compensate undocumented immigrants for the
        <strong>COVID-19 pandemic</strong>. The payment will be exclusively available for those workers who have not
        received any federal benefit due to their immigrant status. The program is known as <strong>The excluded worker
            fund,</strong> and it can also benefit the other low-income workers who have not received any pandemic
        relief measure yet.
    </p>
    <p>The Excluded Worker Fund can provide eligible recipients with payments of $15,600 (tier 1 benefit) or $3,200
        (tier 2 benefit), depending on their eligibility. In NYC, the program is expected to benefit nearly 290,000
        people.</p>
    <p>To be eligible, candidates must have lived in New York prior to March 27, 2020, and demonstrate that they lost
        income after February 2020 due to the pandemic. Acceptable forms of identification include a state-issued
        driver's license or IDNYC card, a passport, and marriage or birth certificates.</p>
