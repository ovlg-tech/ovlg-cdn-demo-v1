<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>You can file a Chapter 11 bankruptcy even if the debts of your company are more than $2,725,625 (secured and unsecured debts). As per the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, Section 1113, the increased debt limit for filing Chapter 11 is $7.5 million. However, the case must be filed after the enactment of the CARES Act and will be valid for 1 year. Thereafter, the amount will be revised to the previous one.</p>
<p>Also, for Chapter 7 and Chapter 13, corona-virus related payments from the federal government are excluded from the analysis. Corona-virus related payments will not be considered to determine a debtorâ€™s disposable income in case of Chapter 13 reorganization bankruptcy.</p></div>
