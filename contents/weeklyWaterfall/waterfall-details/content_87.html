<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Credit cards can be a great asset or a great burden, depending on how a cardholder uses them. There are some deadly sins which you should avoid to strengthen your credit score. Sins such as - bumping up against your credit limit, not checking your credit score, applying for too much credit, taking out a cash advance, applying a card that’s out of your league, closing all your credit card accounts, not checking your monthly credit card settlements - can damage your credit score.</p>
<p>Well, you won’t probably go to hell for committing any of these sins, but you may find yourself not getting a loan from the lenders due to your bad credit score.</p></div>
