<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p><strong>FAFSA forms will available from October 1, 2016</strong>. There is no need to wait till January 2017 or estimate your income as you have done in the previous years. You can fill out the form easily with your <strong>"prior-prior" tax information</strong>. You can easily get all the figures from your 2015 income tax return and submit the form quickly. You can even use the <strong>IRS Data Retrieval Tool</strong> to import the numbers into your FAFSA form. This would not only simplify the process but also reduce the chances of getting subjected to verification. In case, your income status has changed lately, then contact your childâ€™s college after submitting the FAFSA form to give your 2016 updates.</p></div>
