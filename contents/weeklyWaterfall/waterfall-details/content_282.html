<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Scammers are everywhere and they use different and unique techniques to hack your passwords, social security number, credit card details or other personal information. One of the most common and effective ways is sending email attachments. Once you click on the attachment, the <strong>malware will automatically upload the malicious software</strong> onto your computer without your knowledge. And, if it's a spyware, then it can be more harmful for you. A <strong>spyware can track the keystrokes</strong>. So, once you type the passwords, credit card details, social security number or other personal details, it'll register your information. Now, it's unnecessary to explain what will they do with that information.</p>
<p>So, never open any attachment from an unknown source. Read the email body carefully and if it's important, then you'll get the details from the email body itself. <strong>Stay safe, stay wealthy</strong>.</p></div>
