<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>In the case of Chapter 13 Bankruptcy, until you complete your repayment plan, you can't receive a discharge. A Chapter 13 plan lasts for three to five years. But, during a bankruptcy process,  if you face a problem that can <strong>stay for a lifetime and prevents you from paying off your plan</strong>, you can ask the court for a hardship discharge.</p>
<p>Remember one thing, if you want to qualify for a hardship discharge, you have to show the court that your problem is serious and permanent. Suppose you're facing a permanent medical problem after filing Chapter 13. A temporary financial crisis like losing the job and emergency financial crisis don't qualify for the discharge.</p></div>
