The cost of moving vary throughout the year. If you have the luxury to choose the moving time, then you are in a better position than others. The cost of your move gets affected by - the season and the day of the week. You can save during the non-peak seasons, that is, during the fall and winter. Also, make an effort to move on Tuesday or Wednesday to get better pricing, as Fridays and Thursdays tend to be the busiest days of the week for movers. So, if you do have some flexibility on your moving date, you can save yourself a little extra money.</p></div>
