<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Do you want to make extra money during Christmas? Are you tempted to do secret shopper jobs and build your cash reserve? If so, then be little careful. This is because scammers often offer these jobs to get your credit card information or money. They would ask you to pay ‘employer’ money for supplies before doing the job. You would pay money in advance but won’t get any proper work or payment later.</p></div>
