<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Ignoring outstanding credit card debt can take a bite out of your paycheck or bank account. Credit card companies may garnish your wages just like most other creditors. However, in order to take part of your paycheck, the credit card company must first sue you in court and obtain a judgment. If a judgment creditor is garnishing your wages, federal law provides that it cannot take more than 25% of your disposable income. Your disposable income is established by subtracting required deductions from your total paycheck. Required deductions include things like federal and state taxes, state unemployment insurance taxes, Social Security, and required retirement deductions. They do not include voluntary deductions, such as health and life insurance, charitable donations, savings plans, and more.</p></div>
