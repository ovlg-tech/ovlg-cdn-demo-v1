<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Set <strong>security permissions and passwords on your smartphones</strong> so that a fraudster can’t accidentally rack up charges on your iTunes and other accounts. Give strong passwords so that no one can guess them easily. Users can make in-app purchases only after giving the exact password. Another way to stop fraudulent charges is to remove the credit card information from iTunes. Use a prepaid gift card for buying music, games, and other items.</p>
<p>Fraudsters can still hack your information and make in-app purchases. But their options are limited to what is available on your gift card. They can’t deplete your entire checking account.</p></div>
