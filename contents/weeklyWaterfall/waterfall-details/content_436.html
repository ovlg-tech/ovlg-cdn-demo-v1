    <p>Are you inheriting any property this year? Now, you might not be able to get the property tax exemption if you don't make it your primary residence.</p>
    <p><strong>Proposition 19</strong> has significantly modified the parent-child or grandparent-grandchild property inheritance tax exclusion. Before prop 19, parents/grandparents could transfer their property to their children/grandchildren without fair market re-assessment. As a result, the inheritors used to get the property with the original low tax rate even if they don't use it as their primary home.</p>
    <p>Under proposition 19, If the property is worth more than $1M, it will be partially or entirely reassessed, resulting in the loss of some or all of the Proposition 13 tax benefits. Inheritors can keep the initial tax rate only if they use it as their primary residence. If chosen otherwise, they have to pay the tax based on the current assessed value, which could cost them thousands of dollars more than their parents!</p>
