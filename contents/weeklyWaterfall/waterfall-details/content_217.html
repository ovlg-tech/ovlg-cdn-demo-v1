<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Do you claim medical expenses to get tax reimbursement? If so, then <strong>mention medical mileage on your income tax return</strong> as well. You can get additional tax deductions for your out-of-pocket expenses. For instance, the trips to and from appointments, transportation expenses incurred by a parent for accompanying a child, etc. This is not all. You can also get deductions for miles to perform charitable service.</p>

<p>Just remember, you canâ€™t include insurance, maintenance and depreciation.</p></div>
