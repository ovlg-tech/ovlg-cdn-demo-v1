<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>It is also illegal for a collector to take a check that is post-dated by more than 5 days unless the consumer is notified in writing. If the debtor is not notified, then itâ€™s a violation of FDCPA. You can get <strong>monetary compensation of up to $1000</strong> along with actual damages including overdraft fees.</p>
<p>Above all, if you don't have enough money in your account, the check will bounce and you may face criminal penalties or civil penalties for that. You will have to pay a charge to the bank as well. So, if you face anything like this, take help from FDCPA. You have legal rights against debt collectors.</p></div>
