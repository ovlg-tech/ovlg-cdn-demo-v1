    <p>On 9th September, President Biden has declared a nationwide Covid 19 vaccine mandate in response to the delta
        variant that has caused a spike in the covid 19 hospitalization and death cases. Under this rule, employers with
        100 or more employees must ensure that each employee is either vaccinated against COVID-19 or tested once a
        week. He also mentioned that such businesses must also give their employees paid time off so that the employees
        and their families can get vaccinated. Companies that do not comply with Biden's directive might be fined up to
        $14,000 per violation, the White House announced.</p>
    <p>Along with that, President Biden would require 17 million healthcare workers in hospitals and other healthcare
        facilities funded by Medicare and Medicaid to be completely vaccinated.</p>
    <p>Biden's vaccine plan has already raised many questions and arguments regarding mandates. Using
        <strong>OSHA</strong>, Biden's plan to execute this mandate would require businesses and major corporations to
        put safety standards that protect employees' safety. Though the rule is likely to survive legal challenges, no
        date for implementation has been set yet. We'll notify you when the final date is set.</p>
