<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>f you locate that an old debt has reappeared on your credit report as a new account or contains inaccurate information about its age or status, be very careful! It is wrong to restart the credit history clock after 7 years. One of the most ominous tactics used by collection agencies or collectors is the re-aging of account entries. This is where a  collection agency or an original creditor changes the date of last activity or charge-off so that an item stays on your credit report longer than it should be. So, you may file a lawsuit if someone tries to do so.</p></div>
