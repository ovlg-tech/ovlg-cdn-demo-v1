<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Do you have any plan to file for bankruptcy after moving to a new state? As per the law, you have to wait for at least 2 years or 730 days to be eligible for state's bankruptcy exemptions. Does it mean you can't file bankruptcy in these period? Yes, you can! In such situation, you have to <strong>take advantage of 180-Day Rule</strong>.</p>
<p>According to the rule, a person is eligible for getting the exemptions of the state he lived in for the greater part of 180 days period prior to the 730 day period preceding your bankruptcy. For example, if you're living in California for the last 638 days, you're not eligible to get the state bankruptcy exemptions as you haven't lived there for 730 days. But, 730 days before you filed for bankruptcy you lived in Texas, and for the 91 days before that you lived in Texas as well, then you would be eligible to use Texas state exemptions.</p></div>
