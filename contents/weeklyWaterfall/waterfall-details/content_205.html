<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>A debt consolidation loan may seem to be an easy option to shed debts. But, this may not be a convenient option for your credit score. And, this is because, <strong> your credit score may plummet a little bit</strong> when you take out a new installment loan to pay off your past dues. A <strong>new inquiry will appear on your credit report</strong> along with a big installment loan, which in turn will drop your credit score. So, itâ€™s best to avoid debt consolidation loan.</p></div>
