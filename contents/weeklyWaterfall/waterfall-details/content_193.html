<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Got a gift card? Use it within a year or else <strong>you'll be slapped with dormancy fees every month</strong>. As per the law, there is no limit on the amount of fee that credit card companies can charge.</p>

<p>Usually, gift cards expire 5 years after they are issued. If you don't use gift cards within 12 months, then you have to pay dormancy fees unnecessarily.</p></div>
