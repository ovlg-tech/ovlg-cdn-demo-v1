<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Are you being threatened by the debt collectors for sending you jail for your unpaid medical bills? Don't worry about it. Rather, you can sue the debt collectors for threatening and harassing you. According to the FDCPA law, <strong>no person can be sent to jail for failing to pay off any civil debt</strong> (Civil debt is any debt between t non-government entities or organizations). Medical debt comes under civil debt and no-one can threaten you for imprisonment. The most the collectors can do is to sue you to the court. You have to attend the court and follow the instructions carefully.</p>
<p>If you want to avoid the court, then try to <a href="https://www.ovlg.com/debt-settlement">settle your debts</a> outside. The sooner you get rid of debts, the better for you because paid medical collection accounts won't make a negative impact on your FICO score.</p></div>
