<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Debt collectors often ask about your wage for settling your debts. Many people get convinced by their words and share the income information. But, you should always remember that they don't have any authority to know about your wage, and you're not bound to share that information. If you disclose your income to them, <strong>they will get a scope to charge a hefty amount</strong>.</p>
<p>If you have already shared you SSN number with the debt collectors, they can <strong>know about your bills and expenses easily</strong>. No other details are required to settle your debts. So, from next time, if any collector asks you about your income, just avoid them.</p></div>
