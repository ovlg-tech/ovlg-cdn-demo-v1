<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Its good if you are a “friend in need is a friend indeed”. A cosigner is a person who takes equal responsibility of the loan payment as the primary borrower. Before you cosign for a loan, be sure you can afford to pay the debt if the borrower defaults on the loan. When you cosign a loan, make sure you are capable of repaying the loan, and that it won’t cause a financial hardship or jeopardize your own credit. We all want to help our friends and family, but you also need to think about your own needs.</p></div>
