<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>To avoid insurance paperwork and mandated treatment regimes, doctors and testing facilities sometimes offer discounts for cash-paying patients. So, go and have a talk with your doctor and grab your share of discount! </p>
<p>Some instructions which you could follow to find the least expensive care without sacrificing quality are - make sure everyone you see is in-network; ask about alternate facilities; find lower-cost after-hours care; ask about any extra discounts; switch to generic drugs; get your drugs through the mail; sign up for Medicareâ€™s new benefit and special programs; contribute to a flexible spending account; get triple tax breaks from a health savings account; get credit for everything; negotiate a lower payment and use money-saving apps.</p></div>
