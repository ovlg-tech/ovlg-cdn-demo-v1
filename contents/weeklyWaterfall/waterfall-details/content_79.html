<li>California is suffering through a record drought.</li></ul>
<p>With California facing its worst water shortage crisis in modern history, Save Our Water - a partnership between the Association of California Water Agencies(ACWA) and the California Department of Water Resources(DWR) - has launched a ‘California Don’t Waste’ Public Service Announcement(PSA) campaign to bring awareness in simple ways so that citizens can save water every day. So, don’t waste water as you have to pay $500 for misusing it. Water is the driving force of all nature so try to preserve water as much as you can.</p></div>
