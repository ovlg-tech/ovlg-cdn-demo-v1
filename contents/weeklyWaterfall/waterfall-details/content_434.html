    <p>As per federal law, States must provide Medicaid eligibility for pregnant women with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty level (FPL) through 60 days postpartum. However, removing these new mothers abruptly from the program just 60 days after giving birth seems practically immoral as the period is too small. <strong>The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021</strong> has given states the option to extend Medicaid postpartum coverage from 60 days to 12 months. The new option will take effect starting April 1, 2022, and will be available to states for five years.</p>
    <p>Most low-income moms usually start going for their first postpartum checkup around the 6th week after giving birth. Unfortunately, it means by the time they find about their postpartum issue; they lose their coverage. The Medicaid coverage expansion is expected to provide significant support for the maternal healthcare of low-income moms by reducing their worries of losing health insurance coverage during a critical time.</p>
