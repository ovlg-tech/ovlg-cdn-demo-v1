<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Are you planning for getting a divorce? The first thing you should do is close your joint credit cards to avoid any future debt problems. Creditors don't care about your separation. If you have joint accounts, <strong>you are legally responsible to pay off the debts</strong>. It's not easy to close or remove another person if you owe some money in your joint accounts. In that scenario, request your bank to freeze the card to avoid any new charges.</p>

<p>So, it's better to clear up your debts, <strong>shut down old joint accounts and check your credit report</strong> (to make sure your partner is not listed on any of your cards) before drawing up your divorce papers. Because, if your old partner files for bankruptcy, creditors will come after you for payments.</p>

<p>So, if you want mental peace after divorce, plan your finances first.</p></div>
