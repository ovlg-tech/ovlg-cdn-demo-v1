<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;">It might be a tradition to buy discounted TVs on Black Friday. However, not many people know that most TVs are poor in quality and have an appalling picture quality. You won't be able to play fast-paced video games. Neither would you be able to enjoy fast-paced action scenes.Consumer Reports give “A” rate to only a few TV models. Forget rating, most TVs that are sold at an unbelievable price during Black Friday are not even recognized by the Consumer Reports. If you really want to buy a TV, then wait till March. A lot of retailers want to get rid of older sets in that month. So, you can get a good TV set at a discounted price.</div>
