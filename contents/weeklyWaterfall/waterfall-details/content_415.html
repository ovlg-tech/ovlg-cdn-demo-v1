<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>The pending and ongoing debt collection actions come to an end once you file for bankruptcy. Creditors are not allowed to call but it happens sometimes. It comes under automatic stay violations and if you face anything like this, you can <strong>seek actual damages, punitive damages, attorney's fees, etc</strong>.</p>
<p>Once you get a call from the creditor after filing your bankruptcy, the first thing you have to do is to check whether included the debt on your bankruptcy petition. If you included the debt,  then inform the creditor about the bankruptcy case number, the date of filing, and the court where you filed your case. If you still get calls from the same creditor, then you will get all the benefits mentioned above. You just have to prove that the creditor willfully violates the automatic stay.</p></div>
