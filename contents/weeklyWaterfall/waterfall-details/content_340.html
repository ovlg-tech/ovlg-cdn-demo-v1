This new law (SB491) even prohibits you wearing them on top of your ears. Earlier, it was only headphones or earplug but now this new law specified earbuds also. <strong>Failing to obey this law can cause you a fine as high as $160</strong>.</p>
<p>This law does not apply to the people operating construction equipment or emergency vehicles, as well as anyone using a hearing aid.</p></div>
