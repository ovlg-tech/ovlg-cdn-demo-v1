<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p><strong>Have you lost your credit card? Has anyone stolen your credit card?</strong> If so, then report the issue to the police and the credit card company within 2 business days. If you don't, then be <strong>ready to pay $50</strong>. If you take more time to report the matter, then you'll be in a bigger trouble. You'll be <strong>charged $500</strong> or less than that. Besides, the thief who has stolen your credit card won't sit idle for so many days. He will use your credit card for making fraudulent expenses. So hurry up!</p><p></p></div>
