<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>With the help of color printer, scanners and copiers, it has become easier to replicate any documents. But. you should <strong>never replicate any US or Foreign currency</strong>. It is illegal and you can face up to <strong>15 years imprisonment with a hefty fine</strong>, even, the authorities can seize the instruments used for making the bills.</p>
<p>If you want to copy the US currency for fun or decoration, keep in mind that it has to be at least <strong>50% larger or 25% smaller of it's actual size</strong>. If you want a color print, then do it one side. So, be careful while copying it.</p></div>
