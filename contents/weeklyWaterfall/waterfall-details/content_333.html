<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>The new Federal Law prohibits <strong>debt collectors to stop contacting a person for not more than 7 times per week</strong> for medical debt. The Federal Law already prohibits collectors from making calls before 8 am and after 9 pm.</p>
<p>As per the new provision, there is also restriction imposed on emails and text messages. Consumers can opt out of contact through emails and text messages. The National Consumer Law Center is also proposing to limit such calls to a maximum of 3 per week since a person can accumulate medical debts from various places for a single medical event. So, if you are getting more than 7 calls a week, contact FDCPA now!</p></div>
