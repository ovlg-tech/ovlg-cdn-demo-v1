<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Ever had a no-expense month in your life? It can be difficult but it's totally worth it. Begin 2015 on a good note. Make January your no-expense month in 2015.</p>
<p>Thinking how can you survive without any expenses? Well, just cut down on your frivolous expenses. Don't spend any money on fast food, home decoration, accessories or clothes. Cook food with what you have in your pantry and freezer. Most likely, your freezer is still well stocked from holiday meals. Consume those foods first to save more money.</p></div>
