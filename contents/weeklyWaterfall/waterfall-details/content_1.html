    <p>According to a survey, cigarette prices vary by state, running from $10.06 in New York to $4.50 in Missouri. The
        average pack costs $5.95. Your savings on a pack-a-day habit amount to about $180 each month or more than $2,100
        annually. So, quit smoking since that money could buy an eight-day luxury Caribbean cruise or a 60-inch LED
        flat-screen TV.</p>
