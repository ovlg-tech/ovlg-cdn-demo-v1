<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Are you in financial crisis? Do you have any plan to exceed your credit card limit to meet your financial needs? Never do so. Exceeding your credit limit means you're inviting problems in your life. First of all, the credit card issuer can <strong>charge you as much as $35 for crossing the credit limit</strong>. It can continue for the next three billing cycle if your card balance stays over the limit for each billing cycle.</p>
<p>Secondly, the interest rate will increase to the card's default or penalty rate. The <strong>interest rate can raise up to 30%</strong>. Other than this, your credit score can get a hit if you go beyond your credit limit. So, always try to stay within your credit limit to enjoy a stress free life.</p></div>
