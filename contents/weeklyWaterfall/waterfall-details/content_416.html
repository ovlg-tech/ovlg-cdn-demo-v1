<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Technically, there is no statute of limitations on a student loan. This means government, private lenders, and debt collectors can sue you any time if you don't pay off student loan debt. But what will you do if a <strong>debt collector sues you for a student loan debt</strong> you have already paid off 20 years back? What if you have lost all the documents since many years have already passed?</p>
<p>You can get the court to throw the case out of court because of a doctrine called the “statute of repose,” meaning that because of the passage of time, you could not be reasonably have been expected to keep the records showing that you paid off the loan several years back.</p></div>
