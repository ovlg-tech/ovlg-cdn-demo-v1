<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Have you incurred credit card debt in 2016? If so, then you can <strong>transfer the outstanding balance to a new credit card with low interest</strong> and save money. This process is popularly known as <strong>balance transfer method</strong>. Some credit card companies donâ€™t charge a penny on interest for the first 12-18 months from the new customers. But remember, this is only a promotional offer. You need to pay off the total balance within the introductory period or before the interest kicks in.</p></div>
