<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>If you are a Federal Student Loan Borrower and havenâ€™t been making payments, be careful before filing your tax return. One of the collection tools  available for defaulted student loans is called a Federal Income Tax Return Intercept. Depending on the status of federal student loan, you may end up losing your tax refund. </p>
<p>If your loan is in default, you may not get your tax refund due to a Federal Income Tax Return Intercept. If you are in default, use this time to take action.  Get your loan out of default, get a payment plan you can afford, and then you can file your tax return. You can avoid future intercepts by rehabilitating your federal student loan and remaining current on payments.</p></div>
