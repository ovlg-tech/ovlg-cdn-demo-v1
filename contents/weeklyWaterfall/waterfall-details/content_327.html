<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Hospitals have a tendency to hand over your unpaid medical bills to a third party debt collection agencies. And, the <strong>debt collectors take part in patient medical intake procedures</strong>. The debt collectors force the ill or injured person to extract money and, sometimes pressuring the patient to hand over a credit card or make a payment up front.</p>
<p>This is illegal and you have rights to file a lawsuit against such practices. FDCPA never allows such things but if the debt collector works in that hospital, then FDCPA law can't help you. FDCPA laws are only applicable to the third parties.</p></div>
