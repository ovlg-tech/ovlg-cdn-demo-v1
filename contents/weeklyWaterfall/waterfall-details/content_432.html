    <p><strong>Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (CAA 2021)</strong> was passed on 21st Dec '20 and has brought some
        temporary changes in the bankruptcy code that will last up to 27th Dec '22.</p>
    <p>Under <strong>Section 1001(b)</strong>, Courts may grant Chapter 13 discharges to debtors even after they default
        on up to three monthly residentiary mortgage payments after 13th Mar 2020, as a result of COVID-19.
        This rule is also applicable for the debtors who include residential property in a "cure and maintain" plan and
        participate in a qualifying loan modification or forbearance.</p>
    <p>If you have defaulted on mortgage payments and yet want to obtain a Chapter 13 discharge, make sure to establish
        that the missed payments were due to covid19 related financial hardship.</p>
