<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Have you planned to take your family for a nice dinner in a restaurant without knowing the tipping law? If so, then check if the restaurant is not adding <b>‘automatic gratuities’</b> onto the bill. And, if it does, then the restaurant should report it as <b>‘service fees’</b> and this would be considered as <b>taxable income</b>. Plus, you should avoid paying any tip to the bartender/server since this would lead to making double tip.</p>

<p>As per the new rule, to be a tip:</p> 
<ol>
<li>You should have the freedom to determine the tip amount</li>
<li>You shouldn’t be forced to pay the tip</li> 
<li>There shouldn’t be any kind of negotiation</li> 
<li>You should have the right to decide who gets the payment</li> 
</ol>
<p>As per the NY law, restaurants who engage in this illegal practice <b>have to pay $250 as a penalty</b>.</p></div>
