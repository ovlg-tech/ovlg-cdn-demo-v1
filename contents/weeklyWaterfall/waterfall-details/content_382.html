<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Worried about your student loan payment during this pandemic situation? It's a real concern for more than half of the American population. But, Cares Act brought a smile to their faces.</p>
<p>CARES Act, section 3513 provides relief for student loan borrowers with Direct Loans and also for FFEL loans(currently owned by the U.S. Department of Education). Direct Loan and covered FFEL borrowers will have their <strong>payments suspended through September 30, 2020</strong>. While student loan payments are suspended, the loans shall not accrue any interest and the month of a suspended loan payment will be treated as if a loan had been made for purposes of loan forgiveness and loan rehabilitation. The suspension period will result in <strong>no negative credit reporting</strong> and also an involuntary collection of the loan will be suspendedâ€”no wage garnishments, tax intercepts, offset of federal benefits, or any other collection activity. So, don't worry! Just focus on your safety.</p></div>
