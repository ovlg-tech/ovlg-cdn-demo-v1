<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Rose Day embarks the Valentine week. This is the day when you buy roses for your beloved to express your affection for him/her. So rose is the most sought after flower on this day. Quite naturally, the price is also higher than the remaining days. If you wish to spend less on this day (you have a long list of expenses for the week ahead), then buy roses from local grocery store. You can even try out the online sellers. But, make sure you don't buy roses from high-end florists. They charge more. Typically, ten roses cost between $25 and $60.</p></div>
