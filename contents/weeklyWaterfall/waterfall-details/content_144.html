<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Is there any error on your credit card bill? Wondering what to do now? Well, you can withhold payment in this case but with care.</p>

<p>The first step you need to take is to inform the credit card issuer first about the error. You can call at their Toll-Free-Number and report the matter immediately. The credit card issuer can be sympathetic with you and give you lots of alternative options. They may even refund the cost of the eligible item if the retailer doesn't agree to take it back. Just make sure you approach the credit card issuer within 3 months of the purchase.</p></div>
