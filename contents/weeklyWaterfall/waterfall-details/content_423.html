<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>The Recovery Rebate Credit, authorized by CARES Act and the COVID-related Tax Relief Act is basically a tax credit that is given against your 2020 income tax. If the combined total of your two stimulus checks is less than the recovery rebate credit amount you may be able to get the difference back on your 2020 tax return in the form of a larger tax refund or a lower tax bill. You don’t need to pay the difference if it’s another way around.</p>
<p>If you haven’t got a stimulus check yet, for which you’re eligible, then claim the amount due as a “recovery rebate” credit on your 2020 federal tax return in Form 1040. Make it a hurry, cause President Biden has already signed the third stimulus check.</p></div>
