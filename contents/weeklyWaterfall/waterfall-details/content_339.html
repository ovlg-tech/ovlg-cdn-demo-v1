<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Are you getting collection calls on Sundays after 5 p.m.?

According to the FDCPA law, debt collection agencies can call you between 8 a.m. and 9 p.m. (your local time) Monday through Saturday and between 1 pm and 5 p.m. (your local time) on Sundays.</p>

<ul><li> Call 800-530-OVLG and <a href="https://www.ovlg.com/fdcpa.html">get in touch with FDCPA attorneys</a> to fight back against abusive debt collection practices.</li>
<li> Let the OVLG attorneys file a lawsuit and help you win a financial reward of $1000 for the mental agony you have suffered.</li>
