    <p><strong>CA Proposition 19</strong>, billed as <strong>“The Property Tax Transfers, Exemptions, and Revenue for
            Wildfire Agencies and Counties Amendment,”</strong> has brought some significant changes in property taxes
        assessed on personal residences. This law took effect on April 1, 2021.</p>
    <p>According to this law, If you are a resident aged 55 and older, or severely disabled, or a victim of a wildfire
        or natural disaster, Proposition 19 allows you to continue receiving tax benefits while relocating to a new
        home. Under this new law, eligible homeowners can enjoy a few benefits like</p>
    <ul>
        <li>They can transfer the taxable value of their existing home to their new replacement home, purchased or built
            anywhere in the state within two years of the sale of the original primary residence.</li>
        <li>They can transfer the low tax base to a pricier home by paying higher property tax only on the difference.
        </li>
        <li>And people over the age of 55 or with severe disabilities can now transfer a tax assessment three
            times(disaster victims would continue to be allowed one transfer).</li>
    </ul>
