<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>According to the ECOA individuals cannot be discriminated on the grounds of their racial background, religious background, sex or marital status. The only accepted factors that can be used to determine whether or not an individual is acceptable for a loan are the financially related information such as one's credit score, income and existing debt load. Organizations found in violation of this Act have to face class-action suits. If found guilty, the offending organization could have to pay out punitive damages totaling up the lesser of $500,000 or 1% of the organization's net worth.</p></div>
