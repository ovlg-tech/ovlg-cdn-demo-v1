<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Have you defaulted on the mortgage and failed to modify it? Well, in that case, you can file Chapter 13 bankruptcy.</p>
<p>As per the law, you have to pay the full amount of mortgage arrears over a <strong>maximum period of 5 years in Chapter 13 bankruptcy</strong>. If the arrears are $120,000, you have to pay $2,000 per month on top of making the regular monthly payment. This can take a toll on your finances.</p>
<p>You may start assuming that you have no alternative other than losing your home. But you're wrong. You can <strong>file Chapter 11 bankruptcy where you can pay off $120,000 in 30 years</strong> without any additional interest. So your monthly payment will come down to $333 which is a lot more affordable.</p></div>
