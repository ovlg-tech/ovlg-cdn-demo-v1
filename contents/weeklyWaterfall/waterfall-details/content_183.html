<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>As per the new law (effective from July 1, 2016), lenders will <strong>run a credit check on new customers in Utah</strong>. So, if youâ€™re planning to borrow a payday loan for the first time, then boost your credit score first. The new also mandates that the lender has to inform <strong>how you can pay off the loan with an extended payment plan</strong>. But, this would only happen when you default on your payments. The lender is also required to inform you how many times he can file a lawsuit against you to seek repayment.</p></div>
