<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Bankruptcy is a process to restructure your financial situation. But, it's a very complex process. There are lots of laws (both Federal &amp; State laws) that you have to follow through out the journey. People have a tendency to hide their income increase from the bankruptcy court. Never involve in such practices. It can <strong>lead you to a hefty fine or imprisonment</strong>.</p>
<p>In case of bankruptcy, the court must have all of your accounting details of what you have, how much you earn and how much you owe. According to that information, the <strong>court will guide you a repayment plan</strong>. So, if your income increases, it's your responsibility to inform the court and the court will alter your debt repayments. Remember, if you coordinate with the court properly, you'll get a better result.</p></div>
