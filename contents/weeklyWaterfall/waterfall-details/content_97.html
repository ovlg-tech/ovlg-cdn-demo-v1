<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Finally, the time has arrived when you shop for friends and donate for a healthy wallet. It is the time when you're desperate for making donations to charitable organizations and claim tax-deductions in the next year. But, desperation or over-eagerness is not good since it can throw you into a pool of trouble. What you need to do is find out if you're donating for the right causes. If you're determined to get tax deductions for the present year, then donate to an organization having non-profit status.</p>
<p>Always remember, fraudsters are over-active and hyper during festive season. Just like the hungry retailers, they also want to make more money during festive season. Make sure you don't end up donating money to them.</p></div>
