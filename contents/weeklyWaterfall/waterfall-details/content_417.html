<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Never ignore or avoid the creditors in the post-judgment discovery process. They can send you to jail for several weeks till the debt is paid off. Cooperate pro-actively or file bankruptcy if you don't have money.</p>
<p>Basically, it is not possible for the judgment creditor to know about your workplace, your assets, or the other things that can help it satisfy its judgment. In such a situation, the judgment creditor will send you a post-judgment interrogatory or a notice to appear at the deposition. They will question you about your assets and income. Debtors are entitled to attend those proceedings. If you <strong>neglect or avoid appearing, the creditor's attorney can ask the judge to issue a civil warrant against you</strong>. This is why you should never ignore a lawsuit and you should call a lawyer immediately if you are sued.</p></div>
