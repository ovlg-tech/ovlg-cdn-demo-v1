<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>A new tax benefit has been announced for the people who become blind or disabled before hitting 26. They can now open tax-exempt savings accounts for meeting qualified expenditures related to sickness. These accounts will be quite similar to 529 college saving plans. For instance, tax will not be imposed on investment income or withdrawals for:</p> 
<ul>
<li>Conveyance</li> 
<li>Medical technology </li> 
<li>Home health aids</li>
</ul> 

<p>Each disabled person can have only one ABLE (Achieving a Better Life Experience) account. And, the yearly contribution limit is capped at $14,000 in 2015. Besides, it will not have any effect on disabled people’s eligibility for Medicaid payments. </p>

<p>So, all those who are disabled before the age 26, please don’t miss out this opportunity. Use it for getting tax benefits.</p></div>
