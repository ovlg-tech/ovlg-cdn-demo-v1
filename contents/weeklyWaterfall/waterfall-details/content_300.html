<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Have you filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy and facing financial difficulties to make the payments? Talk to your attorney and inform him about your problems in making the payments. If your reasons are genuine like job loss, having a surgery or maternity leave then he can <strong>file a motion with the reasons for payment suspension</strong>. Remember, having a tight financial month cannot be a reason for suspending payments.</p>
<p>The creditors and the bankruptcy trustee can object to that motion. But, as per the Bankruptcy Law Network, if your attorney can convince the trustee that your reasons are genuine, you won't have any problem getting the motion approved.</p></div>
