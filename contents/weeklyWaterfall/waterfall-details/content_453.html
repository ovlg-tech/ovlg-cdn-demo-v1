    <p>Do you want to avoid calls with your debt collector? Now you have an option to choose your preferred method of communication.</p>
<p><strong>The Fair Debt Collection Practice Act (FDCPA)</strong> safeguards clients from abusive debt collection practices by setting constraints on debt collectors. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has released a final regulation that will take effect on <strong>November 30, 2021</strong>, to give consumers more control over their collection process.</p>
<p>The updated version allows consumers to control how collectors contact them. They can still stop all debt collector communications, just as they could previously, and with some limitations can now block communications via a specific channel if they desire (15 C.F.R. 1692c(c), 12 C.F.R. 1006.6(c), 12 C.F.R. 1006.14(h)). This means you can now ask your debt collectors to stop calling a specific number or to stop calling altogether, and they must abide by your request.</p>
