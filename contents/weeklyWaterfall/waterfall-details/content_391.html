<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Good news for small businesses. As part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, Congress created the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). New rules would make it easier for businesses to qualify for loan forgiveness under the PPP. The first $349 billion in funding under the PPP was exhausted in less than two weeks in a frenzy of demand by businesses for the forgivable loans. Loan applications for the second $310 billion in funding were way down, however, due in part to concerns about the loan forgiveness rules. As of May 27th, there was still $135 billion in PPP funds available.</p>
<p>To be eligible for the PPP loan, you need to have:</p>
<p>1) 500 or fewer employees whose maximum reside in the United States.</p>
<p>2) A sole proprietor, an independent contractor, or a self-employed individual.</p>
<p>3) Section 501(c)(3) non-profit.</p>
<p>4) Section 501(c)(19) veterans organization and a few other factors.</p></div>
