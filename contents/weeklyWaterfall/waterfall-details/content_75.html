<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act is a federal law which regulates the conduct of bill collectors. The "FDCPA"  was passed in response to abusive conduct by collection agencies.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Act is to provide guidelines for collection agencies which are seeking to collect legitimate debts, while providing protections and remedies for debtors. The in-house collection departments do not fall under the FDCPA. The in-house collection agents can be a bit aggressive while collecting debts. So, don’t rush to court when you are dealing with ‘in-house’ collection department as the FDCPA laws won’t be able to help you.</p></div>
