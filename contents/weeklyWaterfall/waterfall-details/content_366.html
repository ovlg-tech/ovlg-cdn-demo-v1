<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Have you been sued by the debt collector for a default judgment? Check the details properly. As per the new rule (US Supreme Court ruled 8-1), the one-year filing deadline for the FDCPA lawsuit will be considered from the time the violation has taken place instead of the time it is discovered.</p>
<p>People have confusion regarding this One-Year period. According to FDCPA, it imposes a one-year limit on filings from the date on which the violation occurs, not when it is unearthed. So, a debt collector canâ€™t sue you if that time is over.</p></div>
