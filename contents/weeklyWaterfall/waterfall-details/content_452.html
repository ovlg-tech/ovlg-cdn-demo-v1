    <p>For many students and their parents, the college became significantly more expensive due to the Covid-19 epidemic
        and the ensuing economic crisis. As a result, they've become even more reliant on the <strong>Free Application
            for Federal Student Aid</strong>, or <strong>FAFSA</strong>, for their children's college funding.</p>
    <p>On Friday, Oct. 1, the FAFSA filing season for the upcoming 2022-23 school year began. Through FAFSA, you can
        apply for state and institutional aid in addition to federal aid. Over a dozen states give awards on a
        first-come, first-served basis, particularly for programs with limited finances. As a result, the earlier pupils
        file, the better. In October, students who file their FAFSA are often awarded more than twice as much grant
        money as those who file later.</p>
    <p>So, if you want to maximize your aid eligibility, file your FAFSA as soon as possible.</p>
