<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Have you ever been threatened by the debt collectors for revealing your debts to your friends, colleagues or neighbors? If this happens, never get frightened. The FDCPA Law is with you. According to the law, <strong>debt collectors cannot disclose your existing debts to anyone</strong> other than the authorized persons. The debt collectors can contact the persons you know to get your phone number, your address or your workplace. But, they cannot disclose anything about the debts to any one of them. They can only inform to your spouse, parents or the attorney representing you.</p>
<p>If you find the debt collectors are violating the FDCPA law, you can complain to the FTC. You can get up to $1000 as compensation.</p></div>
