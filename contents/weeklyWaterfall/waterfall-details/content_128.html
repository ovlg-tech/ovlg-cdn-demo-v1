<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Online dating sites can be a devil in disguise when you’re desperately searching for the love of your life. Scammers often create fake profiles with stolen pictures from social networking websites to woo you. They’ll profess their true love for you in the first few days. And once these scammers have won your heart, they’ll start talking about their financial hardships. They’ll ask you to create a new bank account. Initially, they’ll deposit a small amount in that account and then will tell you wire the money (using Western Union or Money Gram) out of the country. After a few days, both the scammer and the money will vanish from your life.</p>

<p>Don’t be a fool or be part of a crime. Do an image search first. If you find that the same image has been used under different names, then beware! You’re dating a scammer.</p></div>
