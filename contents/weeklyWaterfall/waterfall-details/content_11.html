<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>If you've racked up debt on a high-interest credit card, transferring the balance to a card with a lower interest rate is a good idea. Getting a balance transfer card is a good way to consolidate credit card debt. You can take advantage of a low introductory 0% APR interest rate on credit card balance transfer. But donâ€™t forget to monitor your credit while using your card to track your progress.</p></div>
