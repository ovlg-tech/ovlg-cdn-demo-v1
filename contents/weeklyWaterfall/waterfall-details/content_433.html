    <p>Since 2014 Americans are using the marketplace while buying their health insurance. Getting eligible for premium
        tax credits/subsidies makes coverage more affordable, but eligibility depends on the income limit.</p>
    <p>People with household incomes greater than 400% of the poverty line were previously ineligible for premium tax
        credits. But with the <strong>American Rescue Plan 2021 (Section 9661)</strong>, that subsidy cliff has been
        eliminated for 2021 and 2022. Under the new rule, people earning 400% of the poverty line or more are only
        required to spend 8.5% of their household income to purchase the benchmark plan. This new rule is beneficial,
        especially for those who are older and/or live in an area where premiums are expensive.</p>
