<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Know the minimum speed limit of the left lane on the road. A law implemented in a few states where you can be <strong>penalized up to $500 for driving slow or for blocking at least one car</strong>. The law is called "slowpoke". The aim of the law is to keep the slow drivers away from the left lane.</p>
<p>Indiana, Georgia, Florida and New Jersey have already implemented that law and the <strong>result of issuing tickets are increasing day by day</strong>. So, while driving in left lane of these states, maintain your speed or else, be ready to get the ticket.</p><p>
