<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Are you trapped in payday loans? Is your payday lender charging you higher interest rates? Don't worry! Check your state's usury (unreasonable and excessive rates of interest) as the interest rate varies from state to state. If you find the payday lenders are charging higher interest rates, then <strong>lodge a complaint to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)</strong>.</p>
<p>Payday loans are not legal in many states. If payday loans are legal in your state, then they have to follow the state laws. Every state has strict laws against payday loans. So, if you find yourself a victim of higher interest rates, don't hesitate to take legal action.</p></div>
