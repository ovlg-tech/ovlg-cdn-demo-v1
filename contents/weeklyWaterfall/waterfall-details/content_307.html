<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Can’t pay bankruptcy fee in installments? Well, in that case, you can pay the fee in installments. But this option is <strong>only available for only Chapter 11 bankruptcy</strong> (which is also known as reorganization bankruptcy), and the maximum number of allowed installments is 4. Make sure your last installment is not more than 120 days after submitting the bankruptcy petition. If you have a tremendous financial hardship and can’t pay off the fee, then you can ask for an extension till 180 days after filing bankruptcy.</p></div>
