<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>A surprising law allows you to be sued for childhood medical debt. So pay off your childhood medical debt once you turn 18.</p>
<p>If you received care in your childhood and your parents either failed to pay the bill or couldn't pay, then creditors can come after you once you turn 18. <strong>As per the "Scott Law",  even if the parents don't pay a bill then the minor is held responsible</strong>. The statute of limitations period starts from the day you turn 18 years old. If you fail to pay off debt and lose the lawsuit, then the court can issue a judgment against you. In that case, you may be liable to pay the judgment amount and the court fees too.</p>
<p>Try to pay off medical debt or settle it after you turn 18. If you're not comfortable, then you can <strong>hire a debt settlement company to settle your medical bills</strong>.</p></div>
