<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>More than 110 million Americans may find changes in their credit report very soon. FICO is coming up with its new credit scoring model, <strong>known as FICO score 10 Suite</strong>. Now, FICO will consider trended data to provide creditors a more detailed view of your creditworthiness. Trended data will have the information on how you have managed your credit accounts in the past 2 years. If you don't have a history of <strong>paying off your outstanding balance amount in full every month, your credit score may drop</strong>!</p>
<p>However, the good news is, FICO is going to implement this new scoring model during mid-2020. So, make sure to pay off your outstanding balance amounts in full every month. Otherwise, you might notice a drop in your credit score!</p></div>
