<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>If you have any plan for opting a new loan, then don't apply for a new credit card. New credit card will lower down the average credit age and the credit score as well. <strong>15% of your credit score depends on the credit age</strong>. So, a new credit card will lower the average of all the accounts. Other than that, a new credit card invites an inquiry on your credit report. And, an inquiry means a business has checked the credit report for the approval of your application. <strong>Any inquiry cost 10% drop off your credit score</strong> and if there's any additional inquiry, it could cost a few more points.</p>
<p>So, it's better to avoid taking out a new credit card to make things easier for you.</p></div>
