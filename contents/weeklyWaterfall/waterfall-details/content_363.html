<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Is your landowner is asking you to move out because he wants to convert the rentals to a condo or “substantially” remodel the property? Well, don't forget to discuss the relocation cost. As per the AB 1482 (The Tenant Protection Act of 2019), in such scenarios, your <strong>landlord is bound to pay you the relocation fees equal to one month of rent</strong>.</p>
<p>From 1st Jan' 2020, <strong>AB 1482 will prohibit evictions and non-renewals without "just cause"</strong>. This law applies to those tenants who have lived in a unit for at least one year. Remember, this law does not apply to cities like San Francisco, Santa Monica, Los Angeles, etc. which has its own local "just cause" laws.</p></div>
