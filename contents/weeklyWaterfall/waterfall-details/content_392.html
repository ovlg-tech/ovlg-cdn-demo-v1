<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Have you been diagnosed with the virus SARS-CoV-2 or with corona virus disease or your spouse or dependent is diagnosed with COVID-19? If the answer is yes and if you're having monetary difficulties, then you can <strong>take out money from your retirement account now</strong>.</p>
<p>Under the CARES Act, individuals can <strong>withdraw up to $100,000 from IRAs or workplace retirement plans before December 31, 2020</strong>, if their plans allow. In addition to IRAs, this relief applies to 401(k) plans, 403(b) plans, profit-sharing plans, and others. These withdrawals may be included in <strong>taxable income either over three years</strong> i.e. one-third each year or in the year taken, at the individual's option. It's a great option for all of us, we can grab this opportunity if needed.</p></div>
