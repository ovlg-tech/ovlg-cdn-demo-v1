<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Received a mail from the FTC regarding a consumer complaint? Have you been blamed of breaking the laws of Consumer Credit Protection Act? If yes, then don’t panic and click on the mail to download the document containing the description of the complaint accompanied with a link.</p> 

<p>The mail may not be a legitimate one although it may appear as if the mail has been sent from the FTC email address. The web address may also look genuine. But if you type that web address, then you’ll be redirected to some other website.</p> 

<p>Even if you receive such a mail, don’t open it or click on the links given in the mail. Once you do it, a malware will be installed into your computer and allow scammer to regulate your online activities. He can also use your personal information to commit fraudulent activities.</p>

<p>Best course of action - Delete the mail or just forward it to spam(at)uce(dot)gov.</p></div>
