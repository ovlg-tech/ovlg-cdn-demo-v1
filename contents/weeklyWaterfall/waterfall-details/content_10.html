    <p>Credit cards give you the advantage of paying just a small percentage of your balance each month. Even if it is
        easier to make the minimum payment, it costs more in the long run. Some reasons why you should pay more than the
        minimum on your credit card include: save money on interest; pay off the balance sooner; improve your credit
        score; be ready for a mortgage and increase your available credit.</p>
