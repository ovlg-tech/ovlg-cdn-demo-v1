<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Do you know that it is illegal for credit repair companies to lie about removing accurate and timely negative information from someone’s credit report in return of upfront fees?</p>
<p>AS per the CROA – the Credit Repair Organizations Act, credit repair companies can not remove accurate and timely negative information from anyone’s credit report. So, if they practice such things and charge you some upfront fees for clearing up a clouded credit report, it'll be <strong>considered illegal</strong>. If you experience such a thing, make a complaint to FTC.</p></div>
