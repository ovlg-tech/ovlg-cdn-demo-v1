<div class="description_text" style="color:#555; display: block;"><p>Try to avoid racking up new debt during the 70 to 90 days before filing bankruptcy, otherwise, you will not be able to discharge debts through bankruptcy. As per the bankruptcy law, unless it was for necessities of life, such as food, clothing, and utilities), a <strong>debtor who filed bankruptcy is not allowed to take on a new debt</strong>.</p>
<p>If you use cash advances or credit cards to buy any luxury items within 70 to 90 days before filing bankruptcy, the creditors can object your discharge by arguing that you did it intentionally to avoid the payments. This is called "<strong>Presumptive fraud</strong>" and the court can reject your bankruptcy file. So, if you want a smooth process, prepare yourself first.</p></div>
