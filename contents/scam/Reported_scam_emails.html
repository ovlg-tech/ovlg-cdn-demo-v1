        <br>Date: Feb 25, 2016 From steve woltman &lt;*********@hotmail.com&gt; Good morning, I have gotten a couple of
        emails from somebody claiming that they represent Advance cash america saying that I took out a loan for $400
        and now owe $890. This person has not given me any info on this bogus claim, yet they said I should accept the
        settlement offer. STRANGE. No info, just send money. I do NOT even know who Advance Cash America is. I have not
        taken out any loans,, and I mean No loans. My bank acct was hacked 2 to 3yrs ago and acct was drained. Ever
        since then I get these threatening emails. So I guess I'm asking for some clarification. Is this your company or
        is this a scam??? I will be contacting the State ATTORNEY GENERAL's office regarding this Bogus claim. Due to my
        bad heart and likelihood of having a 2nd stress related heart attack, I do not need this kinda B.S. Here is the
        email address these are coming

        <a href="mailto:stacy@oakviewlaw.com">stacy@oakviewlaw.com</a> Attorney Sarno, I thought you
        might want to be aware that someone is using your name and workplace in a scam (see email below). They have been
        emailing me constantly for over a month. I contacted your place of work the first time I received an email and
        they said they would open an inquiry. I don't know if you were aware of that. When I called the number on you
        profile
        they said they had no record of you. I also chatted with Ron (chat on the website) and he said that you
        did not work. However, I told him about the situation and that the number on your profile was incorrect and that
        they had no record of your employment. I just wanted to make you aware of the situation. With best regards,

        <br>I'm writing to you regarding suspected fraudulent phone calls that I have been receiving. This has happened
        on two occasions the first being in October of 2014, the caller states that I made a request to a payday loan
        company and that I never paid the loan and I now have a case against me and that if I did not pay there would be
        a warrant for my arrest. At this time I did not know what this was, I did know that I had not taken any loans
        etc and my bank accounts would reflect this. The caller was more aggressive and I did not know what to do so
        this time I did give them a total of 286.00 from a green dot loaded card. They sent my "settlement papers" from
        a David Wright with contact number of 408-915-5242, ext 7860 this number that is no longer in service,
        surprising! Now I am receiving a second group of calls in the exact same manner, stating I have this loan (which
        I do not) and I now owe them 426.00 or a arrest warrant will be issued. They request it in the form of only a
        money-gram. This time I need help to make this stop!! This is clearly a scam and I don't know how to proceed
        with this. This information they are giving me is Eric Johnson
        <a href="mailto:ovlg.lawfirm@mail.com">ovlg.lawfirm@mail.com</a>, 323-739-5456, the callers both times

        named David who said that a company called cash advance America is suing me because they said that they give me
        a payday loan in the amount of 500.00 dollars and that I never paid it back. Which is crazy because I never got
        a loan from those people. Any loans that I have out I am paying on and am current on. To top it all off he
        couldn't give me the date of the supposed day that I received the money.He said I could either settle out and
        pay 476.00 which is what they are looking for or I would have to pay 5500.00 for court fees and what not. I will
        enclose a part of the email which will give you his name extension and your company name. Thank you very much,
        Mr. DAVID CORREIA, As I have confirmed with you on call to send you a copy of your case file, I have attached
        your case file in this mail. Please download the attached document. This document states that you have some
        pending debts. Please call me as soon as possible to resolve this issue.. Please revert for any clarification.
        Thanks &amp; Regards, David Wright, Extn: 7860. Oak View Law Group. (408)-915-5242 .

        <br>My name is Jasmine Jones and I received calls last week in regards to a case that was file agains my name
        and SSN. The guy's name is David Wright and his phone number is 408-915-5242 ext 7860. He then said that I would
        need to pay $376 or they would release info to the courts and send a warrant. I was nervous about this so I had
        him give me an extension until today to make at least half of the payment. After a few days of deliberation, he
        finally agreed that I could pay on 12/5 and that he would send me payment information. Today (12/5), he sent me
        payment information to visit a Walgreens, CVS, Rite Aid, 7-eleven or Radio Shack and purchase a Green Dot Money
        Pak card. It said to scratch off the back to get the card number and send those numbers to law
        <a href="mailto:firm.ovlg@gmail.com">firm.ovlg@gmail.com</a>. I have not sent any information as this
        seem like a scam. Please inform me of what to do next. Thanks, Jasmine Jones

        <br>Good morning, I’ve been through this before and today it’s starting all over. In the past, these foreign
        idiots got hold of my debit card info somehow and ran it for over a thousand bux that I didn’t have. Big mess. I
        called the # associated with the transaction and after I got angry, they told me that I would not be getting my
        money back because they are poor people. Really? I was livid. Anyway, it’s starting again today. They called my
        cell phone and my work phone. 508-296-8798. Said his name was Joe Smith (really??) and that he is from Oakview
        Law Firm, there is a case pending against me, need to call them back, blah blah blah. Foreign accent (Indian,
        Arab, or something) I’m not calling these morons back, and I did have to close my bank account the last time. I
        hope you folks can figure out how to stop these idiots from getting $ from hard working people. Thank and hope
        this info helps a bit.

        <br>Good evening. My name is ________. I was contacted at 916-842-6822 and a voicemail from Mark Smith from
        oakview law group threatening me about a lawsuit and if I did not respond he will take actions and it would be
        my worst nightmare. ( I don't understand what attorney would actually leave a voice message like that.I
        attempted to call the # 7186909021 while recording it all it gave me was a beeping line once I disable the
        record a call the # rang) he introduced himself and started explaining his reason for the call. He states his
        client is advance america and there was a submission to file a lawsuit against me for an outstanding loan. He
        then gave me an ultimatum, he states that we can settle this outside of court or take it to trial and if its
        taken to trial he will send off the paper works tomorrow. He told me I had an outstanding balance of $1027 and
        for the settlement if paid today he is willing to accept $736.39 but if taken to trial I will be sued in the
        amount of $12000. It started to get suspicious because as an attorney he did not follow the correct protocal. I
        was not notify by whomever this company was of an outstanding balance, a letter of collections or nor was I
        served. By ca law I do have 30 days after the date I'm served to file a response to the court. To make sure that
        the call was authenticated, I started questioning the man that claims to be an investagtion officer. I had
        inquire when the loan was requested and for how much and why it took the long period of time to get in touch
        with me. He stated it occured from 2009 to present and the reason it took so long to contact me was due to he
        just finished the paperwork. I then asked him the present address of the time , the man cannot verify. I would
        atleast think as his profession he should have all his documents available. I asked him to verify the ssn on the
        document. He put me on hold for 15min to locate a ssn he then mentioned to me it was ____________, which isn't
        at all mines. I then asked him to repeat it 4 more times. I told him that'll I do my research due to the fact
        that what I was being held accountable for doesn't make sense and nor did his story. I had inquire to speak to
        upper management, he insisted he was the only one available. I told ill call back, he inform me that he may not
        be available. Call was disconnected and not returned. This man had a thick accent of arab or mid eastern. I then
        did a few more research and found that other people were also being harrassed by scammers using the same law
        firm name. I hope this will help with the investigation.

        <br>Good afternoon,<br>For the last three months I have been embarrassed, harassed by these men from Oak view
        law group. These men are either Indian or Arab decent. They call my workplace four or five times a day. They use
        generic names such as Jim Carter, Stan Lee, and Christopher Watkins. What I don't understand is why when you ask
        them to verify the debt, or ask who the creditor is they start to curse and say rude things, but you can't hang
        up on them as they will just keep calling. My co workers are sick of them. Stan Lee is the head guy in the
        accounting department. So I was on the phone with him and got the royal cuss treatment. Then he tells me he can
        send the document to my email. So he sends me the most generic statement letter. It has misspellings and no
        capital letters. So I am the fool because they told me if I don't pay, they hate to say what is going to happen
        to me. I have sent letters to my State Attorney General and my next step is the FBI. Someone has to know how to
        stop these people from these malicious acts. It seems as soon as you pay one, they keep calling back. The number
        that the call from is 1-760-457-2203. Please help me!!!<br>&nbsp;

        <br>Dear Mr. Kalani I have received still another collection call, which I deem to be fraudulent. It seems like
        the few times I applied for and received a payday loan from US Fast Cash, I get these calls. The two are either
        connected or someone is scamming from my application to make up a collection story. The callers always sound
        like they are of Indian descent, and they normally give me a court date just a few days away from the call. They
        also refuse to send documentation to me via US Mail - saying, "We don't have to do that!" From the reviews, your
        firm appears to be reputable and well respected. It's unfortunate that some one is giving it a bad name. There
        must be something we can do. I am sure others are falling for their scam, and they need to be stopped. Should
        your firm want to pursue legal action against them, I would be willing to serve as a witness to the scam. Oh, a
        phone number recorded on my cell is 347-390-0587. With my best wishes,
