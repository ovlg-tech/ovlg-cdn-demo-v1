    <div class="letter-heading"> A debt settlement agreement letter is typically used to confirm in writing what verbal agreement you had with your creditor or collection agency to settle your debt. However, make sure you send two copies of the letter via certified mail so that you can have proof that they have received it. Moreover, request one signed copy of the agreement.</div>
