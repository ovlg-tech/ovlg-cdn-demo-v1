But I am very disappointed to discover that the disputed information still exists on my report.<br><br>I demand a formal description of the procedure adopted by you to verify this claim. I would also like to know the names of the businesses, the addresses, and phone numbers of all the entities/people who were contacted during the verification process. Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, I have the right to be informed about all these details.<br><br>It is disappointing to find that a credit bureau does not maintain accuracy norms, despite a consumer's request for information verification. I request that you comply with the law and furnish me with all the required information that I am seeking, within a period of 15 business days.<br><br>I am resubmitting my request to expedite the verification procedure and look forward to hearing from you.
            <br><br><br><br>Sincerely,<br><br>Your Signature_________________.<br><br>Your Name____________________.<br>
