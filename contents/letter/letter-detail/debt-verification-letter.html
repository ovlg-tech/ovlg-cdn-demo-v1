    <div class="letter-heading"> The contents of a Debt Verification Letter and Debt Validation Letter are nearly identical. The major difference lies in the nature of the dispute and to whom you address the letter to. While a debt verification letter is sent to the original creditor, a debt validation letter is sent to the collection agency. If you think the debt has been falsely reported to the credit bureau, then a debt verification letter is the best way to get your debts verified. You should also notify the creditor that you will not hesitate to sue them, if they fail to justify what it has reported to you and the credit bureau. Here is a sample of a debt verification letter that will help you understand what you should include in a debt verification letter: </div>
