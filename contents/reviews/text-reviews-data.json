I spoke to Mr. Ron Clark the FC financial counselor and he assured me that everything will be alright its a simple process and linked me up with Ms. Alice John at first and she was very cordial with all my issues but had to pass my case on to Mr. Sheldon Anderson due to personal reasons. Sheldon Anderson was very precise and effective helping me understand to stay focused an continue to make the planned payments to the firm as agreed, I had at least 6 creditors coming after me chewing up my account. Sheldon continued to communicate with me when I became frustrated. His ability to treat me like site says CLIENTS FIRST is for real. I always had communication regardless of time, it was either immediately or quickly the next day. I saved a few thousand dollars with the program. I RECOMMEND OVLG\nCLIENTS FIRST.     VERY HAPPY AND RELIEVED CLIENT. RM\n\nTHANKS  SINCERELY\nSheldon Anderson\nOVLG."

    "testimonialQuote": "Greetings to the exceptional Oak View Law group. \n\nThis is a very proud person writing this testimonial.  No Name for (Privacy)\n\n    The worst feeling in the world is to financially not know how you will make it. In 2017 I was raising my son and\ndaughter as a single father. My bills were piling up significantly and I was in debt to quick fix payday loan sharks, thats exactly what they are. I am a retired veteran with disabilities but that means nothing when your struggling to live and take care of a family of 3. I let an investor take over my home and because I could not make the payments and I struggled. I knew I needed help soon because I  had loans  more than six and I was drowning. One night I was just fed up with this suffering and decided do something right now! I saw the headlines of OAK VIEW LAW GROUP in a clear your debt program talking about clients come first. I decided to give it a try, so I called the number and very lucky to speak to Ron Clark, Financial Coach he calmed me down and asked simple question and made me feel like I can beat this and I was confident after we were done! So I enrolled that same night. My Client Relationship Manager at first was Alice John, she was easy going and worked well with my schedule and and ability to stay in program. Alice John had to move on for personnal reasons and they assigned me to another CRM Sheldon Anderson, this manager undoubtably was on point with everything smooth transition as my new CRM. Sheldon constantly kept me informed with all my creditors and demanded that I do not miss payments to stay on track to settle with these creditors. Mr Sheldon Anderson made this mission to debt freedom happen and kept in contact always letting me know not to worry and that I was doing well. No worries he remineded me, and let him know if there was any he could do, ie arrangments. He also briefed me on every creditor negotiated significant money saving settlements some almost 30 to 40% less. I would often email Sheldon to see if everything was alright, he responded promptly with care and I was first.  Time was perfect and on my side I was able to pay off my debts and everything was on line so I could see my progress. I am a grateful Army Veteran I want to thank the the staff and my new friend and CRM Sheldon Anderson.\n\nThank You     \n\n(RETIRED)\nUS ARMY        \n"

Between trying to keep it running and making the payments on it, we had to take out several payday and personal loans. Before we knew it, we were buried. Bankruptcy wasn't an option for us, so we decided to try debt settlement. Our financial coach, Van Cliburn, got us started and helped us each step until we got everything done to start our debt settlement. We realized we could save hundreds of dollars a month. Pierson Silver, our relationship manager, has always been available to answer questions and has been in contact with our creditors to try to get us the best settlements possible. We even had one who came to our door demanding money, and Mr. Silver dealt with that company on our behalf. We are very grateful to Oak View Law Group, Mr. Cliburn, and Mr, Silver for helping us deal with our debt situation and for giving us a second chance.</p>"

They are trustworthy, fair and accommodating to work with you and your budget. Credit cards are loans that must be paid off. With all the accumulating interests that made debt a challenge to overcome, OVLG goes to great lengths to make repaying credit card debt manageable. If it wasn't for OVLG, we would still be paying on credit cards for perhaps years to come. They will cut the debt down and you will owe less than originally owe. Any dollar amounts are savings. I highly recommend OVLG for anyone who is truly struggling and needs help budgeting their monthly bills while being able to pay down on those credit card debts and pay them off!!! I highly recommend them.</p>"

I bought a car, got a credit card (a couple), and a loan with a bank. Everything was fine because I didn't have money problems so I had no fear of debt. Going into my last year of college is when I hit trouble. My job pulled the rug out from underneath me and told me that because of cuts my 40 hours a week turned into pitiful 15. I couldn't pay bill anymore because of money troubles and I hit debt fast! I had debt collectors calling out the wood -work and I had no Idea what to do! That was when I discovered Oak view. I told them my problems and they worked with me to help get me out of debt. They set me up with a treasury told me to name how much I could pay and after a year I'm finally debt free and it's the best feeling to have! My Relationship Manager Kevin was the biggest help, he called me every 2 months just to check up on me and give me an update. Any type of debt is a burden to have if you have anything from 5,000 to 50,000 Oak view is the way to go. Oak view saved me almost $5,000.</p>"

I really was in a panic and didn't know what to do.  I've filed for bankruptcy once and thought there was no one who could help me anymore.  Somehow, I came across Oak View Law Group.  At first I was extremely skeptical.  I tried to find out as much information as I could before I attempted to contact them.  I checked the BBB and did as much research as I could and I'm glad I did.  They have been absolutely a God send.  They have delivered on everything we discussed in my initial consultation.  And you couldn't ask for a friendlier, more compassionate staff.  They are all so understanding.  Right now, my client representative is Rosamund Pike and she is awesome!  She is on top of everything, is extremely knowledgeable and such a pleasure to work with.  She makes sure to get back to me, answer any questions or handle any situations immediately.  I highly recommend OVLG if you are thinking about whether to use their services.  You don't have to be a slave to debt, especially to those debtors who harass you.  You'll find out about some of the unlawful practices being conducted by some of the debtors.  OVLG will help you and you can be debt free.  Everyone has a different situation, but if you feel trapped like I did, OVLG is a viable option.  It doesn't hurt to find out more information and they don't pressure you when you call.  Do it, you'll feel that monkey come right off your back.</p>"
