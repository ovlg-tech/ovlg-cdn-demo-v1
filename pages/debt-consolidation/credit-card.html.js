                                    <p>When your credit score is good, you can apply for a balance transfer card. This card comes with a 0% introductory APR.

                                    <p>One reason debt consolidation for credit cards is good is because it doesnâ€™t hurt your FICO score. With this plan, youâ€™re paying the full amount at a low interest. Hence, your FICO score doesnâ€™t fall.</p>
                                    <p>However, if you take out a personal loan to consolidate credit card debt, your FICO score may drop initially. When you apply for a personal loan, it triggers a hard inquiry in your credit report, which hurts your FICO score. Once you take out the loan, youâ€™re supposed to make monthly payments. If you canâ€™t, then late payments are recorded on your credit report, which pulls down your FICO score.</p>
                                    <p>The simplest way to use debt consolidation programs without affecting credit is to make payments on time.</p>

                                    <p>You can get a loan from various sources. Personal loans can be obtained within one business day from your friends or a credit union. You can get a debt consolidation loan from peer-to-peer lenders, banks, and financial institutions. However, the best way to get a debt consolidation loan is to knock on the doors of the peer-to-peer lenders, as they offer competitive rates. You can also borrow a home equity loan to repay your bills, since they offer the lowest interest rate. But, remember: a home equity loan is a secured debt. You can lose your house in the event of loan default.</p>

                                    <p>Debt negotiators ask you to save a particular amount in an escrow account (usually known as a trust account) every month to accumulate enough money for settling credit card debt. Once you have saved a specific amount, they will start the credit card settlement process immediately. They will ask your creditors to lower your payoff amount in exchange for a lump sum settlement. They will call creditors and negotiate until they agree to reduce your outstanding balance and waive late fees. Once they agree, debt negotiators will ask you to pay off the amount agreed upon and complete the credit card settlement process.</p>
                                    <p><strong><a href="/debt-management" target="_blank">Debt management plan:</a></strong></p>
                                    <p>Nonprofit credit counseling agencies usually offer this credit card debt relief option to individuals who canâ€™t manage credit cards with simple money management techniques. Here you get a smart budget plan from the counselors who negotiate with your creditors for a lower interest rate on your credit cards and a smart repayment plan. Once they convince creditors to reduce interest rates, you can start paying off credit cards at the new interest rates.</p>

                                    <p>This is the best way to pay off credit card debt when your creditors are not ready to help you. Depending on your financial situation, you can file Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy to pay back your creditors. The U.S. trustee negotiates with your creditors, sells your non-exempt assets within 3-4 months, and disburses payments among them in Chapter 7. However, in Chapter 13 bankruptcy, the scenario is entirely different. Here the bankruptcy trustee gives you the option of paying off credit cards for 3-5 years through a court-approved payment plan.</p>
