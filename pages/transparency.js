              <h2>1. What is the cost of the program?</h2>
              <p>
                OVLG charges 15 percent of the total debt
                amount enrolled in the debt settlement program
                as its success fee. For programs where our
                savings and budgeting experts provide monthly
                financial consultations we charge a $50
                monthly consultancy fee.
              </p>
              <p>
                Consultancy fees are applied towards the
                success fee at the time the success fee
                becomes payable, which means that in many
                cases the consultancy fees become free.

              </h2>
              <p>
                The length of the program is dependent on
                factors like the amount owed, the client's
                ability to make monthly payments, and their
                ability to set aside extra funds for use with
                a settlement offer. With that in mind, on
                average OVLG clients complete the program in
                21 months.

                OVLG works hard to improve every single day.
                As a result, our outcomes improve as well. On

                the amount owed, thereby saving its clients

              </h2>
              <p>
                Some do. It is important to understand that
                debt collectors use collection calls to prod
                clients into making payments. That’s why
                clients may receive such calls, particularly
                at the beginning of the program.
              </p>
              <p>
                In order to reduce or eliminate these calls,
                OVLG follows strategies that make them
                unnecessary, such as promptly following up on
                our client’s behalf, and negotiation with the
                creditors.
              </p>
              <p>
                At the same time, OVLG educates its clients on
                the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA)
                thereby teaching them their rights under the
                act’s provisions.

              <p>
                Clients leave the program for various reasons,
                including inability to make monthly payments
                (11.57%), their desire to file bankruptcy even
                at the cost of their credit scores (4.83%),
                arranging funds from kith and kin to pay off
                their creditors (2.76%) and other reasons they
