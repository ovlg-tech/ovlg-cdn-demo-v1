                                       <p>Credit card settlement is a debt relief method that lowers your credit card balance through a tough negotiation process. Here, you offer the credit card company a lump-sum payment for a reduction in the amount you owe. If the credit card company accepts the proposal, you must pay the agreed amount in one lump sum.</p>

                                       <p><strong>Calculate how much you owe:</strong> Go through your credit reports and make a list of how much you owe on each credit card. If you have any doubts, call customer care and verify the amount.</p>

                                       <p><strong>Check the statute of limitations (SOL) in your state:</strong> Look at this before you even think about how to settle with a credit card. This is extremely important. If the <a href="/education/statute-of-limitations-on-debt.html" target="_blank">SOL</a> has not expired, then take steps to settle your credit card debt as soon as possible. If it has, you can avoid paying off your account.</p>

                                       <p><strong>Verify or validate your debt:</strong> Contact your credit card company and verify the debt if you have any doubt about the outstanding balance. If your account is in collections, then ask the collections agency to validate it in writing. By doing these two simple things, you can avoid overpaying or even being scammed.</p>

                                       <p><strong>Contact a debt settlement firm:</strong> Once you have verified and validated your debt, hire a debt settlement company to initiate the process of negotiating a settlement. Explain your conditions and requirements to the company so that they can act on your behalf. </p>

                                       <p>The debt settlement company will negotiate with your creditors for a lower payoff amount on the basis that you are experiencing financial hardship. They will continue the negotiation process until your creditors agree to reduce the outstanding balance and waive late fees.</p>

                                       <p><strong>Make your agreed-upon payments:</strong> Once you enter a settlement agreement with your creditors, pay it! Your settlement company will send you the final agreement and its terms. Please read it carefully and pay the negotiated amount by the deadline.</p>

                                       <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Make sure your creditors don't report your account as 'paid as settled' on your credit report. Instead, ask them to update it to 'paid in full.' By changing one simple word, you'll save your credit score a lot of pain.</p>

                                       <p><strong>An affordable fee structure:</strong> Obviously, how much they charge you is an important factor. If the fee stricture is high, you will save less. The best credit card debt settlement companies won’t have upfront fees, hidden fees, or excessively high fee structures.</p>

                                       <p><strong>Accreditation:</strong> Accredited companies have passed through a certification and training process. They've learned negotiation techniques and how to communicate with creditors through their certification program. These companies have an edge over those without experience and training.</p>

                                       <p><strong>Good reviews:</strong> Generally, clients give positive reviews when they are satisfied with the performance of the settlement company. Check their online reviews to know what existing clients say about the companies you're considering before hiring them.</p>

                                       <p><strong>Privacy policy:</strong> You'll share confidential information with the settlement company. What will you do if the company shares your financial information with others? Check the privacy policy of any company you're planning to work with. You need to be sure that they won't share your data - and that they've taken reasonable precautions against data breaches.</p>

                                       <p>Credit card settlement is not as easy as you think. There is a lot to it. Here are a few mistakes you should always try to avoid.</p>
                                       <p><strong>Being too quick to send a cease and desist letter:</strong></p>
                                       <p>If you think you can end debt collection calls by sending a cease and desist letter, then you are right. The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act says collection agencies can't call you after receiving a cease and desist letter.  That doesn't mean they don't have other debt collection tools in their box, however.  Some debt collection agencies are quick to file a lawsuit against you when they get your cease and desist letter, just as a matter of policy. So it's important that you know that you may end the calls, but you're likely to get sued for the debt you owe.</p>

                                       <p><strong>Threatening to file bankruptcy:</strong></p>
                                       <p>The problem with threatening creditors with bankruptcy is that they won't believe you. They deal with debtors threatening bankruptcy every day, and very few people actually do it. So they'll be much more likely to call your bluff than cave to your demands.  But what if you're not bluffing? Maybe you actually intend to file for bankruptcy protection. Well, that's not as easy a task as you might think. Congress had made it harder to file consumer bankruptcy, notably in the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act (BAPCPA) of 2005. You need to meet strict eligibility criteria, and you need to owe enough even to qualify.  The credit card company most likely knows those rules better than you do, so it's best to leave talk of bankruptcy for after you've talked to the professionals.</p>
